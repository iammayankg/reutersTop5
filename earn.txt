Standard Trustco said it expects earnings in 1987 to increase at least 15 to 20 pct from the 9,140,000 dlrs, or 2.52 dlrs per share, recorded in 1986. "Stable interest rates and a growing economy are expected to provide favorable conditions for further growth in 1987," president Brian O'Malley told shareholders at the annual meeting. Standard Trustco previously reported assets of 1.28 billion dlrs in 1986, up from 1.10 billion dlrs in 1985. Return on common shareholders' equity was 18.6 pct last year, up from 15 pct in 1985.

(Ivaco Inc) said price pressure on steel products, particularly in the U.S., and the recent increase in the value of the Canadian dollar is expected to result in "minimal" first quarter earnings. It said subsequent quarters should show substantial improvement from first quarter levels but 1987 earnings will not reach 1986 levels as long as those conditions continue. Ivaco earlier reported 1986 profit rose to 44.1 mln dlrs, after a one mln dlr extraordinary gain, from 35.1 mln dlrs the previous year.

HUTCHISON SEES HIGHER PAYOUT, SATISFACTORY PROFITS

Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <HWHH.HK> expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not make any specific projections for the company's earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue. It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year, equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share split. Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper, compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares. Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth. Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct. But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony. He said all of the company's major operations showed improved results in 1986. Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> to <Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric. Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share. Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares. The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish. Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off. He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites. Its major assets are the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel, property development, and interests in Husky Oil Ltd <HYO.TO> of Canada and Pearson Plc <PSON.L> of Britain. REUTER 

CHEUNG KONG CHAIRMAN SEES STRONG RESULTS IN 1987

Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <CKGH.HK> is expecting strong results this year after reporting better than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19 cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a four-for-one stock split. The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15 cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus issue. Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985. Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln dlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> for one billion dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985. Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local property market and substantial increases in contributions from associated companies. "Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for the property market," Li said. "The growth in (Hong Kong's) exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial buildings." Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a second airport.

comalco ltd 1986 net profit 57.1 mln dlrs vs loss 69.1 mln



COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELPED RETURN TO PROFITS

Comalco Ltd <CMAC.S> said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Withdrawal from the <Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the <New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's <Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said. As previously reported Comalco's <Commonwealth Aluminium Corp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at Goldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to <Columbia Aluminium Corp>. Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the provision made in the 1986 accounts. The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5 mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange losses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision. REUTER 
CRA EXPECTS TO PAY FINAL DIVIDEND OF 10 CENTS

CRA Ltd <CRAA.S> said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985. The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid. The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement. Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said. Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd <BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd's <CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln. Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said. Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln. CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985. CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard. Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said. Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs. CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost. REUTER 

ROYAL BANK/CANADA SEES HIGHER 1987 LOAN LOSSES

<Royal Bank of Canada> said it estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr increase over last year. Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and also continued to add to its general provisions for loans to troubled borrower countries. The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the year-ago quarter. The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0 billion dlrs a year ago. In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans associated with the energy sector--continue to have a substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings. Taylor said profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their potential impact on the Royal Bank. The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to 114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago. Reuter 

ROYAL BANK SEES IMPROVED RESULTS

<Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a 19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to report improved results in future earnings periods. "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income, highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement. The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago. Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year. Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago. Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said. The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages. Reuter 

B.C. RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY

<British Columbia Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term. The company said the credit facility is extendable under certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation. It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs. B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended. However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said. Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders, with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31, the company said. If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co <WTC>, B.C. Resources said. The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia. B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and gas interests by 67 pct owned <Westar Mining Ltd>. B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the company said. The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C. Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and exposure to the fluctuating pulp market. It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs. Reuter 
VEREINS- UND WESTBANK TO REORGANIZE NETWORK

und Westbank AG <VHBG.F> plans to streamline its branch network to improve its distribution of financial services, management board member Eberhard-Rainer Luckey said. He told a news conference on 1986 results that branches in Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein would be merged or closed, a branch in Frankfurt opened and that the bank was considering opening a branch in London. Luckey said the bank's total operating profits rose nearly 29 pct in 1986. Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from 42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks. The group balance sheet, including for the first time VereinWest Overseas Finance (Jersey), rose 9.2 pct to 17.9 billion marks, Luckey said. The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2 billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8 billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion while loans to companies rose seven pct. Foreign business and securities trading turnover also increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own account contributed to record operating profits. Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1 mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to 156.7 mln, Luckey said. Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory. The bank's exposure in Latin America was less than two pct of its total foreign credit and in Africa less than one pct. The bank continued to sell some of its exposure in 1986, and will also continue to stock up risk provisions, he said. REUTER 

TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS

French oil group Total Cie Francaise des Petroles <TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986, after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the company said in a communique after a board meeting here. In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs. Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France <RAFF.PA>, told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation. CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985. But its net loss last year, taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985. In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaud said. The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000 this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln francs, he said. Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was a good month, but the situation deteriorated in February." Reuter 

HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE

The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp <HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth, share analysts polled by Reuters said. Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion. They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue. Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year, probably one for three or one for five. The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd <HSGH.HK> is to report its 1986 results on Friday. Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to 12 pct. They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985. Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise, Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct. "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said. Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985. Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985. Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds. The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply. "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks," one analyst said. The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd <WAIA.HK> and <James Capel and Co>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said. Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr flotation of <Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time. The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in <South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs. The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said. Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was much lower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions." Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs. The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, appears to have improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985. REUTER 

CANADIAN IMPERIAL SEES LOWER LOAN LOSSES

<Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>, earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last year's 697.0 mln dlrs. However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of provisioning for loan losses established last year because of many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31. The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5 mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts. Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in calculating first quarter results. The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to 172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal government's Inspector General of Banks. First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs. Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to 213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions, non-interest expenses and income taxes. The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92 billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields. Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100 dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986, but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter. The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4 billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from fiscal 1986 year-end. "Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loans to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987, and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earnings prior to the announcement," Commerce bank said. The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact on future earnings by Brazil's suspension of interest payments. Reuter 

SHELL FRANCAISE RETURNS TO PROFIT IN 1986

Shell Francaise <SFMF.PA>, a subsidiary of <Shell Petroleum NV>, returned to the black last year for the first time since 1982, with parent company net profit of 43 mln francs against losses of 968 mln in 1985 and 1.07 billion in 1984. In 1982 it posted a profit of 329 mln. The company said in a statement that cash flow had improved strongly although it remained negative at 182 mln francs against 1.34 billion in 1985, due largely to improved performances by its main profit centres. It said the results could have been even better had it not been for the collapse of refining and sales profit margins in the last quarter of the year. In 1986 Shell sold 14.74 mln tonnes of oil products against 14.52 mln tonnes in 1985. The company said the results were in line with its targets for the second year of its three-year recovery programme. Meanwhile, <Societe Shell Chimie) said it also returned to profit in 1986, for the first time since 1976, posting net profit of 160 mln francs against a 1985 loss of 57 mln.

It also forecast higher 1987 sales due to an increased order backlog. Revenues last year fell to 191 mln dlrs from 223.3 mln while profit fell to 4.4 mln dlrs from 13.1 mln. Spar added that lower development costs in the communications group and a return to normal operations in gears and transmissions and aviation services "will remove a serious drain on profits" this year. It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications group losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new products and market development, a four-month strike at its Toronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization from customers to start work on new programs.

ABN SAYS PROFIT RISE ENCOURAGING IN VIEW DOLLAR

Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. <ABNN.AS> chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar. Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance, notably in the securities business. He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock. News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders. Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said. Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders, he added. Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities, he said. Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank stocks recently. He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said. He added that losses incurred through loans to tin producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had been written off. REUTER 

CONTINENTAL BANK/CANADA SETS DISTRIBUTION

Continental Bank of Canada, a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank PLC <LLOY.L>, said it intends to redeem all existing preferred shares and distribute a stock dividend to common shareholders. The initial distribution will be in cumulative redeemable retractable floating rate class A preferred shares series II, which will carry a retraction right enabling holders to receive 12.75 dlrs for each share. Continental said the 58.6 mln dlrs of existing outstanding preferred shares will be paid off at par plus accrued dividends. Continental said the notes will carry a dividend rate of 72 pct of prime and it expects that the shares will trade at 12.75 dlrs or more, enabling shareholders who wish to receive cash to do so. The bank said it expects the distribution will be made in early May, subject to various approvals. Continental also said that, as of March 2, it had cash of more than 250 mln dlrs and equity of about 284.6 mln dlrs, allowing for a final total distribution of 16.60 dlrs per common share. Continental Bank said it continues to expect that the final distribution to shareholders will be in the range of 16.50 dlrs to 17.25 dlrs per share and will take place in late 1988 or early 1989. Until the initial stock distribution takes place, regular dividend payments will be maintained on the existing preferred shares, the bank said. The distribution is part of the terms of Continental Bank of Canada's sale of its banking assets to Lloyds Bank Canada, a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank PLC. Continental Bank said Lloyds Bank Canada paid the balance of the purchase price but that it was lower than originally anticipated since Continental was unable to transfer certain income tax deductions to Lloyds Bank. Continental did not give further details. More 
CHARAN SEES AT LEAST 50 PCT RISE IN 1987 PROFIT

(Charan Industries Inc), a distributor of toys and other consumer products, expects 1987 net profit to rise at least 50 pct over last year's 6.1 mln dlrs, president Earl Takefman told reporters before the annual meeting. "We grew basically 100 pct last year, I'm not sure we're going to be able to grow 100 pct again this year but we certainly will grow at least 50 pct over last year," Takefman said. Charan reported profit of 3.0 mln dlrs in 1985. Takefman said he expects sales to rise to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 57.3 mln dlrs in 1986. Fiscal 1985 ended September 30, while fiscal 1986 ended November 30. Takefman said the company is actively looking for acquisitions in the consumer products industry, likely in Canada. The company said it expects to resolve delivery problems this year which last year hindered the growth of its toy distribution business, which accounts for about one-third of revenues. Charan is the exclusive distributor in Canada for <Worlds of Wonder> toys, which include the Teddy Ruxpin voice-activated talking plush bear. Takefman said new products this year, which will be on the shelves for Christmas, include a smaller version of Teddy Ruxpin, a talking Mickey Mouse toy, dancing plush toys, a doll with a voice activated by sound, touch, light and heat, and talking books. The company is also marketing an extended line of "laser tag" kits, which shoot rays of light and tell you when you've hit someone. Other products include a recorder device which allows students to leave taped messages in each others' school lockers, retailing for about 60 dlrs. Reuter 

Canadian Pacific Ltd said fourth quarter 1986 operating profit rose to 91.6 mln dlrs, or 30 cts a share, from 50.7 mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, a year ago. The statement confirmed released preliminary earnings figures the company released in February. A 102.6 mln dlr gain on the sale of CP's Cominco Ltd interest helped raise final 1986 fourth quarter profit to 193.8 mln dlrs or 65 cts a share. The company said a drop in 1986 full-year operating profit to 150.1 mln dlrs from a restated 252.7 mln dlrs in 1985 was due mainly to lower world oil prices. The company said its CP Rail division reported 1986 net income of 119.4 mln dlrs, compared with 133.4 mln dlrs in 1985. It said grain traffic recovered from drought-affected levels of a year ago but was offset by weakness in other traffic areas and increased expenses. It said the net loss from its Soo Line increased to 33.5 mln dlrs loss from 8.7 mln dlrs loss in 1985, mainly due to restructuring charges. Canadian Pacific said favorable developments during the year included reduced bulk shipping losses as a result of a recovery in tanker markets and a turnaround in the forest products sector. Reuter 

Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corp Ltd said it expects 1987 earnings will be lower than last year's previously reported 85 cts a share. But profits "will be at a satisfactory level," the company said in the annual report without giving a specific estimate. Highveld said it expects appreciation of the rand will be offset to some extent by increasing U.S. Dollar prices for its exports as the year progresses. Highveld said measures taken last year by the European Economic Community and the United States prohibiting all South African steel products "presents a challenge to management to place the steel in other areas." The company said overall world vanadium consumption in 1987 is expected to be similar to last year although China's role is still an unknown factor in the total supply-demand situation. "World vanadium production capacity is still believed to be adequate to cater for any foreseeable demand," it added. REUTER 
PREUSSAG SAYS PAYMENT OF A 1986 DIVIDEND NOT CERTAIN

A spokesman for Preussag AG <PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985. Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board. The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group's other divisions. The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions. Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before. The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before. Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln. The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector. The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results. Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year. Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG. Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison figures. Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0 pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes. Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC) subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year. AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world group losses that year. REUTER 

CREDITANSTALT SEES HIGHER 1987 DIVIDEND

Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> is likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12 pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido Schmidt-Chiari said. The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986 from 2.7 billion a year earlier. Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985. Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast. The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion. General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year's better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending. Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries, he said. Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits, Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure. Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations, removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total. In an attempt to generate more foreign business, representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends. Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors. Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in 1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of 2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and large Austrian companies. But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr -Daimler-Puch AG <SDPV.VI> would return a 1987 result similar to the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings. REUTER 

Raab Karcher AG, a trading subsidiary of VEBA AG <VEBG.F>, said it increased operating profit in 1986 despite a sharp decline in turnover, and added there were good chances this profit level could be held in 1987. Operating profit rose to just under 120 mln marks in 1986, from around 100 mln in 1985. However, the group's third party sales fell sharply to 7.2 billion marks from 9.4 billion the year before, largely due to lower prices for energy products, particularly oil and coal, managing board chairman Klaus Giesel told a news conference.

OUTOKUMPU RESTRUCTURES COPPER DIVISION

Finland's mining and metals group Outokumpu Oy <OUTO.HE>, which last week reported a 1986 loss of 83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt to rationalize production and improve profitability. Outokumpu's Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a news conference the reorganization involved a split of the division into a new independent division with six profit centres. Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982. Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in January 1986, <Metallverken Ab> and <Wirsbo Bruks Ab>, that were merged into its copper processing division. The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last year, 42 pct of Outokumpu's group turnover of 7.58 billion. The new Outokumpu division, called Copper Products Industry, is to incorporate Outokumpu's copper production plants, including its two U.S. Subsidiaries <Nippert Co> and <Valleycast Inc>, as well as Metallverken and part of Wirsbo. Outokumpu is planning to make Wirsbo an independent division in the Outokumpu group and transfer only Wirsbo's copper tube production into one of the new division's profit centres. A definite decision on Wirsbo will be taken later this year. The new division will have production plants in Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and the U.S. REUTER 

Earnings per 20-crown share went from 23.79 crowns to 20.45 crowns but the company proposed an unchanged 20 pct dividend. "Foreign exchange fluctuations in 1986 were a very significant factor behind developments in the result before and after tax," Novo said in a statement. "Not only the U.S. Dollar but also other currencies essential to Novo fell in 1986 in relation to the Danish crown," the statement added. In November 1986, Novo purchased 75 pct of shares in A/S Ferrosan, which heads a group specialising in research and development of CNS (central nervous treatment) treatments and the sale of pharmaceuticals and vitamins in Scandinavia. The 357 mln crowns paid in goodwill "had a very limited effect on the 1986 result," the Novo statement said. Reuter 

Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans. Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year. But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable. One senior bank credit officer said "The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions, but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money." The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline. The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled. Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions. The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, <United Saudi Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln. Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985. Other results released so far show <Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals, while <Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals. Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's <CCI.N> Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez, increased provisions sharply. <Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals. Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out. Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity, but one banker said "The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions." From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank <National Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector, bankers calculated. Between 1982 and 1985, <Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine. Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing. Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres. Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners. Other banks such as <Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by the <British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base. Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions. Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported <Saudi Cairo Bank> after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to <Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB. The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans. And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending, conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products. One banker said "Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good." Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money. In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account. REUTER 
BOLIDEN SAYS RESULTS BURDENED BY LOSS WRITEOFF

Swedish mining and metals group Boliden AB <BLDS ST> forecast a return to profitability during 1987 after recording a 1.08 billion crown 1986 loss burdened by a massive write-off. The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and investment conglomerate <Ahlsell AB> this year, said the result included restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns. "These costs have arisen as a results of a change of direction for the group. They are mainly one-off but they have burdened the annual accounts," the company said in a statement. Boliden said the company's liquid assets were 1.36 billion crowns at year-end which together with an investment portfolio of 1.60 billion made it one of the most liquid Swedish companies. As a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposed cancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a return to profitability during 1987, the statement added. Swedish tyres, process equipment and components firm <Trelleborg AB> has taken a majority stake in Boliden since the beginning of this year. Trelleborg then said it had no plans for consolidating Boliden. REUTER 

LYONNAISE DES EAUX FORECASTS 1987 PROFIT RISE

Consolidated attributable net profit of Ste Lyonnaise des Eaux <LYOE.PA> is likely to rise by at least 10 pct this year from the 360 mln francs reported for 1986, Chairman Jerome Monod told a news conference. Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7 mln reported for this year, while group investments should total around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billion annual average of the past three years, he added. Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group's leisure industry, health and communications activities, Monod said. In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development with Club Mediterranee <CMI.PA>, Club Med, of a 200 hectare pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern Central France, he said. Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med as operator of the complex, he said. He gave no financial details but said leisure sector investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next three years. Investments in the communications industry would go mainly to develop the group's cable television activities and its 25 pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in France. Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux would provide about 175 mln, Monod said. Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television advertising market. Total investment by the group in the communications sector, including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400 mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the coming year. Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln and 200 mln over the five years, with the aim of widening the audience to 280,000 subscribers from 12,000, and boosting turnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln.

JACOBS SUCHARD EXPECTS ANOTHER EXCELLENT YEAR

Jacobs Suchard AG <JACZ.Z> hopes for another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986 net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said. The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs. Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the company's target of five pct real annual growth, had been made possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986 which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year. Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24 billion francs was due to currency factors. A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset by growth in operations and by structural changes within the group. Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany. Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25 pct against 25.3 pct. Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further increase in tax levels was expected in future. Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln the previous year. REUTER 

SAND TECHNOLOGY <SNDCF> MULLING REVERSE SPLIT

Sand Technology Systems Inc said it is considering a reverse stock split of at least one-for-10 and expects to report a second-quarter profit, compared to a loss last year. The stock consolidation "is something we're discussing, but it's not definite," Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner told Reuters in an interview. A private placement recently brought the number of outstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July 31, 1986, the fiscal yearend. "The company has always had the aura of a penny stock," Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to apply for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange. Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of five pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs, for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the third quarter should be about the same as the second, he added. Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195 dlrs in the second quarter. After "a disastrous first quarter," Sand hopes to break even in the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company has scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the 33.5 mln dlrs projected in December. The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and Canadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs, or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs. In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost 1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585 dlrs. Shattner believes the company will post better results this year due to several factors. "Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buying products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the second quarter," he said. Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computer accessories such as disk drives, solid-state memory enhancement devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd <HIT> of Japan. Shattner said Sand's affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc, is developing software that lets large maniframe computers handle large databases and share them between applications. It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, which is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major corporations. The company has also reduced costs through some staff cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff instead of straight commissions, Shattner said. And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourth fiscal quarter, Shattner said. Reuter 

Financial and industrial holding company Nord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of 400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said. He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receive approval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two week, when terms would set according to market conditions. He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new investments. Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25 francs, unchanged on 1985.

Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against 147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.

SCHWEIZERHALLE FIRE HIT SANDOZ 1986 PROFITS

Sandoz AG <SANZ.Z> would have reported a percentage rise in net profits "close to double figures" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for November's warehouse fire, a senior company official said. The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which caused severe pollution of the Rhine. Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share. This year began well, with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year, the official said. The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22. Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident. The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the "one pct" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire. Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident. However, the official said the final figure would be "much less than that cited in earlier comments." He gave no further details. In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy <CIGZ.Z>, which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar, the official said. Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to 8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said. Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs. The third major Swiss chemical company, F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Co <HOFZ.Z> has not yet reported its results. REUTER 
ALUSUISSE SEES POSSIBLE BREAK-EVEN IN 1987

Schweizerische Aluminimum AG <ALUZ.Z> (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said. "The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future," he said. "We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that our industrial environment does not worsen." He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses. Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985. Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion. Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985. But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset. Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from 472 mln in 1985. It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining, after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985. Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from 1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22. Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this "radical elimination of the mortgages of the past" painful, but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy. Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion. Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985. In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland <SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp <SBVZ.Z> and Credit Suisse <CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan. The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987. Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts. That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln. The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar alternations were made for previous years. After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895 mln francs. REUTER 

ALUSUISSE PLANS 50 PCT CAPITAL CUT

Schweizerische Aluminium AG, Alusuisse, plans to reduce share and participation certificate capital by 50 pct to cover losses in 1986 and those carried forward from the previous year, chief executive Hans Jucker said. Jucker told a news conference that the greatest drain on its financial resources had been stopped, but after extraordinary charges the net loss of 688 mln francs in 1986 was only slightly under the 756 mln loss of the previous year. The losses in 1986 and those carried over from 1985 made it necessary to reduce capital by 50 pct, he said. However, Jucker said the company improved liquidity through a recovery in cash flow and conversion of 300 mln Swiss francs of credit into a subordinated loan. Trading in Alusuisse shares was suspended on the Zurich stock exchange after today's announcement by the company that it would cut its share capital by 50 pct, the bourse said.

CITROEN EXPECTS HIGHER PROFITS, HELPED BY AX

Automobiles Citroen expects rising sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits significantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after six straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said. Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX sports model, he said: "All the budgetary forecasts that we have been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement in 1987, compared with 1986," he added. Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA <PEUP.PA> group, increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after 11.7 pct in 1986. The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from 2.9 pct in 1986. "Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the demand," Calvet said. "This is a relatively new problem for us." Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise its range and improve productivity. Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986 profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs. This weekend he said that those profit estimates "remain about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic." Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be available throughout most of western Europe within four months. The car has registered just over 20,000 sales. It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous- Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of 1,000 cars a day. The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa. The AX had built up its market share in France to around four pct last month. Calvet said: "Our hope is that once the AX is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent of the national market." REUTER 

The split would improve the marketability of the existing certificates, chief executive Giorgio Ghiringhelli told a news conference. The new bearer shares would be priced at 1,500 francs, compared with a closing price last Friday of 3,325 on the Zurich Stock Exchange, while the registered shares would be issued at 300 francs against a market price of 900.

ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION

<Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move unique among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said. First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is attainable. But it "will be a tremendous achievement because ... they're going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies," Walsh said. Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview. He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990. Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank. Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking. The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980, Cornelissen said. Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co <DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset management, merchant and private banking companies. "It was a heaven-sent opportunity," Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition. "We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up." Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage, in order to exploit "profitable niches" overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management, private banking and advisory services. He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations "before the end of this month" to sell its London-based Savory Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal. "The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business," he said, adding that in trust-type services, "we don't think the international markets are well-served." Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad, Cornelissen said. Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust. Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, "We knew we had to be there." Royal Trust's 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the "immediate future," although "we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities." Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units, Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks. "That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.," said Cornelissen. "That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years." He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust. Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks, trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition for Royal Trust, "but not drastically more," Cornelissen said.

ROYAL BANK/CANADA BRAZIL UNIT SEES GROWTH

Royal Bank of Canada's <RY> small Brazilian commercial bank subsidiary Banco Royal do Canada (Brasil) S.A. sees opportunities for its own growth with an expected substantial increase in Brazilian exports to Canada, Banco Royal president Michael Brennan said. "They (Brazilian exporters) are very interested in the Canadian market because it's an untapped market," Brennan told reporters after a speech to the Brazil/Canada Chamber of Commerce. Brennan said Brazil is currently exporting products like paper machinery and ships to Canada. He said he hopes to see medium-term financing facilities for Brazilian companies reinstated shortly, following an agreement reached in January with international financial authorities. Brennan estimated Brazilian exports to Canada totalled roughly 800 mln Canadian dlrs in 1985 while imports from Canada reached about 700 mln dlrs. Brennan said he expects Banco Royal profit to increase this year from the three mln U.S. dlrs reported for fiscal 1986 ended September 30 but said he could not predict by how much because of the country's uncertain financial climate. Brennan said he expects his bank's growth to come from increased exports to Canada. Banco Royal is the only Canadian-owned commercial bank in Brazil although <Bank of Montreal> has a Brazilian investment bank subsidiary, he said. Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach an equitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign debt, because the Brazilian economy is essentially healthy. He said he believed Brazil might be in a position to resume debt repayments within a year. Brennan said he could not comment on the impact of Brazil's interest payment moratorium on the Royal Bank of Canada. Reuter 

CATHAY PACIFIC 1986 PROFIT SEEN ABOVE TARGET

Buoyed by low fuel prices and favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's <CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said. Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports results tomorrow for its first year as a public company. Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, made its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in May last year. Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the prospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said. They said the airline's performance improved in the second half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln dlrs. The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company's favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said. James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the 1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would affect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits of 1.25 billion dlrs. Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative. "This is reflected in their interim results which showed that profit margin has increased," said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier levels, but profits rose 69 pct. The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on the company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices usually lag behind crude price movements by several months, analysts said. By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and sterling 12 pct. "Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against Cathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields in the first half up 7.2 pct," said James Capel. "This should continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to end the year up 7.6 pct." A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash under management also improved profits, James Capel said. A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed to Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factor declined because of increased competition and an expansion of its fleet and services. James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown climbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fell to 68.8 pct from 70 pct. "Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air," said Tsang. "This affected its load factor." Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier <Hong Kong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay's decision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts said. REUTER 

CHEMIE LINZ EXPECTS SHARPLY HIGHER 1986 LOSS

State-owned <Chemie Linz AG> is likely to record a 1986 loss of some 600 mln schillings compared with a 340 mln loss in 1985, a company spokesman said. Falling sales and lower world prices of fertilisers were largely responsible for the sharp increase, along with the effects of the dollar's fall which has helped to give U.S. Fibre producers a competitive edge, he told Reuters. The firm would have made a small profit in 1985 had it not been for 456 mln schillings lost by subsidiary <Merx HandelsgesmbH> on oil trading. Merx has since withdrawn from the oil market. The firm will announce 1986 results in July. Reuter 

GENSTAR SALE BOOSTS BELGIAN SOCIETE GENERALE NET

Societe Generale de Belgique <BELB.BR> said the near doubling of net profits in 1986 was due in large part to the sale of shares in Genstar Corp. The company, which announced a net non-consolidated profit of 5.31 billion francs compared with 2.82 billion in 1985, said its current profits rose by 19 pct last year, without giving further figures. However, it added in a statement that the company made major capital gains on sales during the year, in particular from the sale of Genstar shares. Societe Generale governor Rene Lamy told last November's annual meeting that 1986 asset disposals would total around 4.5 billion francs, including the sale of Genstar shares to Imasco Limited <IMS.TO>. He predicted a profit on extraordinary items of two billion francs after a rough balance in 1985. In today's statement, Societe Generale gave no figures for extraordinary gains. Reuter 

CATHAY PACIFIC FORECASTS GOOD 1987 PERFORMANCE

Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HK> forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over the year-earlier period. The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987 but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co <BA.N> 747 freighter and one Boeing 747-300 passenger plane in September and November respectively after it took a 747-300 last month. It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14 cents a share. But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance charges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year. A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft deliveries in 1986. However, the company said in a statement good returns from funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and other borrowing. It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel prices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in 1985. Passengers carried by Cathay Pacific totalled 4.2 mln last year, up from 3.85 in 1985, with the passengers kilometre travelled rising to 14.02 billion from 12.56 billion. But passenger load factor was down to 69.1 pct from 71.0 pct. The airline's cargo operations recorded growth of 21 pct in total tonnage over the previous year and a 35.9 pct rise in revenue to 1.79 billion dlrs. Cathay Pacific floated its shares in April, 1986 and is now 50.23 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, 16.43 pct by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp <HKBH.HK> and 12.5 pct by <China International Trust and Investment Corp>.

VW'S AUDI SAYS PROFIT FELL AROUND 50 PCT IN 1986

Audi AG <NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record 221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous year. Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels. He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985's record levels. Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from 9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year. Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits. Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend. Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About alleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models. As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59,800 last year. Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987. Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000. Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000, but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180 in 1985. Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57,000. Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen compared with 1985's 392,000. Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to further new hiring of employees. At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record 39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985. REUTER 

DEUTSCHE BABCOCK TO INCREASE DIVIDEND IN 1986/87

Deutsche Babcock AG <DBCG.F> will increase its dividend on results in the year ending September 30, 1987, chief executive Helmut Wiehn said. Wiehn told a news conference Deutsche Babcock would double the absolute amount it distributes to shareholders. This overall increase would also be due partly to an increase of nominal share capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks. A higher dividend had been anticipated because Deutsche Babcock has said in the past that it will only raise capital when it can make a lasting improvement in the dividend. Reuter 

LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87

Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard Wagner said. Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling interest rates. The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividend to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985. Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: "We will endeavour to maintain the higher dividend in 1987." Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7 billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985. Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total. Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said that it came close to one mln stg. On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed 8.7 pct to 738.9 mln. According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct. Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state. Reuter 
LAURENTIAN GROUP SEES HIGHER SHARE NET

<Laurentian Group Corp> said it expects 1987 earnings per share will show about the same proportionate increase as in 1986. Last year, the company had 25.7 mln dlrs operating profit, or 76 cts per share, up from 11.1 mln dlrs, or 59 cts per share, in 1985. Shares outstanding increased to 39 mln from 27.8 mln. The American holding company, Laurentian Capital Corp, will show a substantial improvement this year, chairman Claude Castonguay said before the annual meeting. Laurentian Capital Corp, which recently acquired two small U.S. life insurance companies, had 1986 profit of 1.1 mln U.S. dlrs, or eight cts per share, compared to seven mln U.S. dlrs, or 68 cts per share. Castonguay said Laurentian Group Corp, the parent firm, plans to fill out its national financial services distribution system and make further acquisitions if the right opportunity occurs. The company also may expand this year in continental Europe, in conjunction with La Victoire, a French insurance company, he said. Reuter 

FAIRFAX SAYS HIGHER TAX HITS FIRST HALF EARNINGS

Media group John Fairfax Ltd <FFXA.S> said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the impact of changes in the Australian tax system. Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to 25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln a year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30 mln from 44.29 mln. Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the company said in a statement. Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue growth in the television industry as another reason for the flat first half earnings. It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of these factors. Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly. But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0 pct rise in revenue, it said. Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from <Australian Associated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's "B" shares in Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L>. This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit. Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr acquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.

SWISSAIR REPORTS LOWER PROFIT AND DIVIDEND

Swissair <SWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pct drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that, in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut its payout to 33 francs per share from 38. President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate. The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year, he said. The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s. Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation. Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation. Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc. While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies. "Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin," he said. "Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines."

PORSCHE HALF-YEAR EARNINGS CALLED SATISFACTORY

Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG <PSHG.F> said earnings in first half year 1986/87 were "satisfactory" despite burdens caused by the dollar's weakness against the mark and stagnating domestic demand. In its semi-annual shareholders' report, Porsche said first half turnover fell six pct to 1.71 billion marks from 1.83 billion in the same period of 1985/86. However, earnings were satisfactory, it said, without giving absolute figures. Domestic turnover fell 26 pct to 283 mln marks from 380 mln. Foreign turnover dipped to 1.43 billion marks from 1.45 billion in the first half of last year, although the export quota rose to 83 pct from 79 pct. The car sector accounted for 1.51 billion marks of turnover, against 1.63 billion the year earlier, it said. Production dropped five pct to 25,876 cars from 27,381. Manufacture of the 911 and 928 models rose six pct to 11,122 from 10,533 units but production of 924 and 944 models was cut by 12 pct to 14,754 units from 16,848 and would be cut further, the report said. Car sales fell four pct to 25.269 units from 26,414 in the comparable half year, the report said. U.S. Demand continued for all models but demand fell in other markets. Domestic sales were 39 pct down at 3,267 units from 5,397, while sales abroad rose five pct to 22,002 from 21,017. Share of exports in sales rose to 87 pct from 80 pct. Investments were reduced to 108 mln marks from 125 mln. Earnings were hit by lower sales and by the lower value of the dollar and currencies in other important markets. Nevertheless, sales and turnover would finish the July 11 year at a "high level," Porsche said. REUTER 

DEUTSCHE BABCOCK SEES HIGHER 1986/87 PROFITS

Deutsche Babcock AG <DBCG.F> expects profits to rise in the current financial year ending September 9 although the earnings level is still unsatisfactory, managing board chairman Helmut Wiehn said. He told a news conference that business during the year had weakened somewhat but was still generally positive. Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26 billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period. However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximately unchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks when current orders from major projects are booked. Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end- February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks. Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at 8.64 billion marks. Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct yield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profits totalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against the previous year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks. Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks. Wiehn said Babcock's liquidity had clearly improved in the current business year, with financial reserves in the first five months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing by 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985/86. He said pre-tax earnings per share for 1985/86, according to the DVFA method, were 26.95 marks from 21.40 marks and earnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8.10. The company earlier said dividend will be unchanged at three marks for ordinary shares and 3.50 marks for preference shares. REUTER 

QUEBEC CAISSE EARNS THREE BILLION DLRS IN 1986

Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, the government agency which manages the province's pension funds, said its investment portfolio earned a net profit of almost three billion Canadian dlrs in 1986, an increase of 300 mln dlrs over 1985. The agency said in its annual statement that it had assets with a total book value of 25 billion dlrs, or a market value of 28 billion dlrs, at the end of 1986. These holdings had a rate of return of 13.5 pct in the year, which was below the Caisse's average return of 16 pct in the past four years and 14.2 pct in the past eight years. The Caisse said foreign equity investments represented 3.6 pct of total assets, while U.S. government securities accounted for another 5.2 pct of the overall portfolio. The agency's holding of U.S. government securities yielded a return of 20.7 pct for the year, significantly more than either the 14.1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the 13.5 pct for all funds under management. "These high liquidity securities, which are held on a temporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protection of the overall bond portfolio, have been efficient," the agency said of the U.S. securities. The agency said it has 7.9 billion dlrs invested in Canadian private sector businesses after channeling 965 mln dlrs of new funds into this area in 1986. The Caisse said it acquired 825 mln of new Government of Quebec bonds and 342 mln dlrs of new securities from other Quebec government issuers during the year. Reuter 

SEA CONTAINERS <SCR> EXPECTS BETTER FIRST QTR

Sea Containers Ltd predicted its first quarter fiscal 1987 net earnings would improve by 10 mln dlrs over the same period a year ago. The company said 1987 got off on a much better footing than fiscal 1986, from which the company recorded a loss of 67.6 mln dlrs, or 6.28 dlrs per share, on revenues of 641.4 mln dlrs. James Sherwood, president of the company, said he expects to record a loss of approximately 12 mln dlrs for the first quarter, compared to losses of approximately 22 mln dlrs for first quarter fiscal 1986. The company emphasized the first quarter is a traditionally slow period for the ferry industry, which is part of Sea Containers' business. Sherwoood said the company's losses were largely attributable to non-recurring events and provisions. He cited the default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers, costing the company approximately 25 mln dlrs. He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing two of its subsidiary's ferry services, and a 10.3 mln dlr provision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and severance pay costs.

STANDARD BANK UNABLE TO MAKE EARNINGS FORECAST

Standard Bank Investment Corp Ltd (SPRJ.J) chairman Henri de Villiers said he could not predict profits for the bank this year because of South Africa's continuing political unrest. De Villiers also warned in the annual report that "failing prompt and decisive political action, South Africa faces a future of violent deadlock between different racial and political groupings." He said South Africa's future economic prospects are "clouded by political and social issues and in the absence of evidence that these are being positively addressed I am unable to offer an earnings forecast for 1987." Standard Bank, 39 pct owned by Standard Chartered PLC <STCH.L>, London, previously reported that 1986 net income rose by 13.8 pct to 209.0 mln rand. The bank said its bad debt losses should begin to decline this year "although it may take some time before they return to accepted industry norms." The annual report showed that the bank's charge for bad and doubtful debts rose in 1986 to 187.6 mln rand from 162.1 mln rand in the prior year. The bank said net income of its Standard Bank of South Africa subsidiary declined 8.2 pct in 1986 to 112.3 mln rand in a difficult banking environment caused mainly by low credit demand. REUTER 

ALLIED-LYONS SEES HIRAM WALKER PROFITS RISING

<Allied-Lyons PLC> sees rising profits from 51-pct-owned liquor producer Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts in the current fiscal year ending in early March, 1988, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in a speech prepared for delivery to Toronto analysts. "We anticipate that Hiram Walker profits will be well above those of the plateau years," he said, referring to the four years up to 1985. "In other words, we will have regained the 1985 position and improved on it," Holden-Brown said. Allied-Lyons won control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last year in a battle against Gulf Canada Corp, which finally got a 49 pct stake after an out-of-court settlement. Hiram Walker Resources Ltd, the previous owner, reported liquor profits of 282 mln Canadian dlrs in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1985, 278 mln dlrs in 1984, 267 mln in 1983, 294 mln in 1982 and 280 mln in 1981. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' financial results for the fiscal year just ended March seven would include three months of Hiram Walker-Gooderham profits, but he did not provide actual figures. He said Hiram Walker-Gooderham's profit improvement in the current year will come from a previously announced reorganization put into effect March 1, 1987 and a close partnership with Allied-Lyons' existing Allied Vintners division.

ALLIED-LYONS SEES SUBSTANTIAL SECOND HALF GROWTH

<Allied-Lyons PLC> will report substantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 ended March 7, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in answer to reporters' queries. "You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyons in the second half," Holden-Brown said following a presentation to Toronto securities analysts. Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year. Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs associated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the company, Holden-Brown also said. But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said. "So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But hopefully you win them all in the end," Holden-Brown said. Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: "No, I don't." "We must never be complacent and we must always be very watchful, but I think we would be very expensive," he said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporate earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies in the food and beverage industry. "That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I think," Holden-Brown said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders take-over bid for the company was "100 pct a growth action." "We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was) defensive, but it never was," Holden-Brown told reporters. Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram Walker, Holden-Brown responded: "Plan might be too strong a word. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to be better known in Canada." Reuter 

Italy's national airline, Alitalia Spa <AZPI.MI>, reporting a 14.6 pct rise in provisional 1986 net profit, said it carried seven pct more passengers on domestic routes last year, but 11.5 pct fewer passengers on flights from North America and Canada. Alitalia said the drop in North American traffic had been due to a general fall in the numbers of American tourists visiting Europe caused by fears of terrorism. The airline reported provisional net profit rose to 55 billion lire from 48 billion in 1985. A spokesman said Alitalia was hoping for an increase in traffic with the U.S. In 1987. It planned to increase the number of flights from Italy to New York to 19 per week, to reinstate flights to Boston and to re-open the direct Rome-Milan-Los Angeles service. The spokesman announced that from March 29, Alitalia would be starting a new weekly service to Shanghai. For its summer 1987 programme, it would be adding 127 extra flights to European destinations -- an increase of 27 pct. REUTER 
RAFIDAIN BANK'S JORDAN BRANCH RAISES CAPITAL

The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Bank said it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country's minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits from its operations in the country. Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to comply with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln dinars -- by the start of 1986. Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi told Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The bank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars. Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided instead to close its operation, banking sources said. Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash. Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an exception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply. They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties. The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to 550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars. REUTER 

AUSTRALIA'S WOOLWORTHS LOOKS TO IMPROVED PROFITS

Woolworths Ltd <WLWA.S> said policy, management and financial changes initiated during the 1986/87 business year should cause profits to reach more acceptable levels in 1987/88 end-February 1. Net profit reported earlier fell 85.3 pct in the year ended February 1. Results for the first month of the new year were encouraging after a period of uncertain consumer confidence and difficult trading conditions, it said in a statement. The Big W discount store division and New South Wales supermarkets produced very disappointing results, it added. Woolworths earlier reported a fall in net profit to 9.27 mln from 63.20 mln on sales of 5.47 billion against 4.83 billion. Capital spending for the year was 119 mln dlrs against 105 mln for the previous year with 50 new stores opened, but total sales were below target, Woolworths said. The company provided 20 mln dlrs against operating profit for the year to cover mark-downs on stock. Extraordinary items included a 53 mln dlr profit on the sale of properties and investments less a 28 mln provision for reorganising the Big W chain. Woolworths is unrelated to the U.S. Group F.W. Woolworth <Z.N>. It has been the subject of takeover speculation since <Industrial Equity Ltd> acquired a 20 pct stake last year. New Zealand's diversified investment group <Rainbow Corp Ltd> bought Safeway Stores Inc's <SA> 20 pct holding in Woolworths for 190 mln dlrs late last year. Safeway put its stake up for tender just in time to take advantage of changes in U.S. Tax laws effective from the end of December, informed sources said.

BAYERNVEREIN EXPECTS UNCHANGED DIVIDEND FOR 1987

Bayerische Vereinsbank AG <BVMG.F> expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987 earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said. He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986. Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from 222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln. Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0.7 pct. Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986. Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks. The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks. The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5 billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said. It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business. The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45. Hackl said that in January and February this year, the bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

SOCIETE GENERALE REPORTS HIGHER 1986 PROFITS

France's Societe Generale <SGEN.PA> bank, which will be sold to the private sector in the second half of this year, reported increased profits for last year. Societe Generale, one of the three largest state-owned banking groups, said in a statement that its parent company profit for 1986 totalled 800 mln francs, up 21.2 pct on 1985's 660 mln profit. This was in line with earlier forecasts of profit of between 770 and 800 mln francs. The bank's parent company gross operating profits were up 5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985. The increase in the bank's gross operating profits was mostly due to a rise in french franc deposits and personal loans as well as the development of its financial activities, Societe Generale said. Parent company net banking earnings last year were also up at 13.9 billion francs compared with 13.57 billion in 1985 while operating costs totalled 7.44 billion francs against 6.67 billion the previous year. Societe Generale President Marc Vienot said in December he expected group 1986 consolidated profits to rise to between 2.5 billion and 2.6 billion francs from 1.62 billion in 1985. Reuter 

SWIRE SEEN REPORTING 20 PCT RISE IN 1986 PROFIT

Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> is likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said. Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits from operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs compared with 1.23 billion in 1985. They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG> unit last May. Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985. Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its "A" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985. Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits, analysts said. The company's aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in <Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay. Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic. Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50.23 pct. Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs. Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd, estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs. "Much depends on properties," said Measor. "And they did a lot better in the second half of the year." Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985. Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm's properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects. Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second-half 1986. During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates, analysts said. "At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year ago," said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year. The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development, which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James Capel (Far East) Ltd. Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expected to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10 mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

SHELL AUSTRALIA REPORTS 45.79 MLN DLR 1986 PROFIT

Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AMS> unit <Shell Australia Ltd>, said its net profit fell to 45.79 mln dlrs in 1986 from 66.76 mln in 1985. Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion, in an extremely competitive and over-regulated environment, chairman and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25 mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a very disappointing year. "A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct," he said. Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on downstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns and the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project. Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation. "It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy, technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production," he said. "The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way," he said. Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to upgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but further investment required an appropriate rate of return, he said. Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77 mln dlrs from 26.35 mln, while investment in property and plant rose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier. Gosper said oil companies would be under intense pressure in 1987 because of forecast slow economic growth. REUTER 

SANTOS SAYS PROFITS HIT BY OIL PRICE FALL

Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer, Santos Ltd <STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985. Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate. Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier. It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54. Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company <TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs. Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments. Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year. Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct. Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism. But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme. "It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly," Massy-Green said.

VOLVO GROUP COMPANY PROPOSES TWO-FOR-FIVE ISSUE

<AB Catena>, in which AB Volvo <VOLV.ST> has a 48 pct stake, said it was proposing a two-for-five stock issue that will raise the company's equity capital to 420 mln crowns from 300 mln. Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985, despite an increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in 1985. The company said that its 1986 performance was best reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln from 221 mln in 1985. Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a trading and industrial company. In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB. This yielded a profit of 386.7 mln crowns and was reflected in Catena's pre-tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in 1985. REUTER 

PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986

The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said. Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last year's 13.3 billion. Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said "had a very serious impact on Venezuela." PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products. The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year. The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining and marketing operations. Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However, Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd. Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of Venezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said. Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the world, Hernandez said. Reuter 
IMPERIAL OIL <IMO.A> TO FOCUS ON HIGHER PROFIT

Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strength and improving near-term earnings performance through operating expense reductions and selective capital spending, the company said in the annual report. Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648 mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985. Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27 dlrs share in the prior year. Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should the investment climate improve and the belief that low or volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next several years. The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show benefits in 1987. During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of workers by 16 pct to 12,500. Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward movement in international oil prices will be sustained. "It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the company's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals of market supply and demand," he said. Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum products division are more promising than before, but are still uncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985. Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in the United States. The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as long as economic growth continues, but future large grain surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure on prices. Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986, compared to three mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter 

JARDINE MATHESON PROFITS SEEN UP SHARPLY IN 1986

A strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd <JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in 1986, stock analysts said. They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985. The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985. James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales. Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow. Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985. But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35 pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG> will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985. The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong Kong Land of <Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September. Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business, which will increase its overall retail income figures. Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct share of <Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985. Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs. But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said. Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests. It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created <Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest. A company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand. Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is likely to develop its own business, analysts said. "The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions," said Hargreaves of Hoare Govett. He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its existing business. REUTER 
CHINA'S FIRST JOINT VENTURE BANK REPORTS PROFIT

China's first joint venture bank, Xiamen International Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about 14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank's first full year of operation. General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit forecast, saying targets were under study. Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group's outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs, up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters. Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parent company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries <Xiamen International Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and <Luso International Bank Ltd> in Macao. The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985 but did not officially open until March 1986. Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign partner, Hong Kong-listed <Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cut last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign banks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the three Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said. Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of 268,000 dlrs in 1985. The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15, Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10). One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on unequal terms with state-owned banks. The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost saturated, he added. Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank. Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the state-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eight foreign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of Hong Kong or overseas Chinese banks.

KLOECKNER UND CO'S 1986 PROFIT FALLS ABOUT 20 PCT

Kloeckner & Co KGaA, the international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves. The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985. It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary because of recent declines in raw material prices. Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in prices as well as the lower value of the dollar. It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held largely by family foundations. Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield of around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to a quarter of the 1986 payment, or around 2.50 marks, the company added. REUTER 
SWIRE EXPECTS CONTINUED GROWTH THIS YEAR

Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> expects continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said. He told reporters:"1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire Properties expects further good results both from properties under development for sale and from its investment property portfolio." He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago. Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG>. Miles said the company will use the money to develop its business, primarily in Hong Kong. Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from 70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25 pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the enlarged capital to the state-owned <China International Trust and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986 profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago. Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct. He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of "a marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with savings in fuel costs." "At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable for the rest of this year," he said, "though there might be a bit of increase later this year.'' Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service operations, even though the marine sector is generally depressed. "Obviously the marine industry is not getting any better," he said. The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year. Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm but said the firm has no available land for a major housing project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong island now near completion. He said the company's 50 pct unit <Hongkong United Dockyard Ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing estate. "But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing," he said. REUTER 

JOHN LABATT SEES GOOD FOURTH QUARTER, YEAR

<John Labatt Ltd> anticipates a good fourth quarter and a new peak in sales and earnings for the fiscal year ending April 30, president Peter Widdrington told financial analysts. He would not make any specific forecast, but said he was optimistic for further growth in fiscal 1988 in the company's brewing and food products operations. Labatt's earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine months ended January 31 from year-earlier 78 mln dlrs. Revenue for the nine months rose to 3.20 billion dlrs from 2.70 billion dlrs. Widdrington said Labatt's three-year business plan, now being updated, targets total sales of about six billion dlrs, including 2.50 billion dlrs in the U.S. Labatt, Canada's leading brewer, has expanded in the U.S. food products industry by acquisitions. Widdrington said Labatt's strategy for U.S. expansion stemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadian food and beverage industry. The U.S. share of revenues for this year will be about 35 pct, rising to 40 pct in fiscal 1988, he said. Reuter 
SNC GROUP EXPECTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS, SALES

<SNC Group Inc> expects 1987 earnings to rise to 1.20-1.40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last year, with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last year's 350 mln dlrs, president Alex Taylor said before the annual meeting. SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals Ltd from the Canadian government. The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt fully in 1987, Taylor said. Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and construction acivities, Taylor said. Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small extraordinary gain. In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.

VARITY<VAT> SEES IMPROVED RESULTS AFTER 1ST QTR

Varity Corp, earlier reporting a full year loss against a prior year profit, said improvement is expected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the inventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realized and its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully integrated. However, operating results are likely to remain under pressure in the first quarter ending April 30, it said. Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 ended January 31 of 23.3 mln U.S. dlrs, compared to a year-earlier profit of 3.9 mln dlrs. Varity said continued deterioration in major markets, a weakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major new lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss. Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode during the latest fiscal year, with worldwide industry retail sales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year's depressed levels, the company said. However, Varity increased its share of the global tractor market by more than one pct to 18.2 pct, it said. The combined impact of costly sales incentives and foreign exchange adjustments on margins was substantial, Varity said. Reuter 
LINDE TURNOVER UP IN FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 1987

Engineering group Linde AG's <LING.F> world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same 1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said. But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and incoming orders increased 1.0 pct. Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group 1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln. Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to 394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln. Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13 to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks. Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for acquisitions. He declined to give further details. While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91 billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level. World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4 pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to 739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge. World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05 billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05 billion marks. Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks. The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group sales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders gaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks. Domestic group turnover rose 8.2 pct to 2.93 billion marks and incoming orders increased 1.9 pct to 2.92 billion marks. The company was producing at full capacity in 1986. REUTER 

HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES

Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> said in a statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales. The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands. World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in 1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01 billion from 42.72 billion. Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct. The statement made no mention of net profit figures. Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23. In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from 1986, Hoechst said. Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell. Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to <American Hoechst Corp>. Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities. Roussel Uclaf <RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated partners did not perform as well as in 1985. Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in extraordinary costs. The fall in raw material prices was not enough to compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and currencies, Hoechst said. The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the acquisition of <Celanese Corp>. Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to form <Hoechst Celanese Corp>. REUTER 
BHP NET SEEN AROUND 600 MLN DLRS FOR NINE MONTHS

Australia's largest company, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> (BHP), is expected to report a net profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuters said. This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31 1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs. The analysts estimated that the group would report a third quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter. BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier. The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and steel earnings. They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been affected by industrial and production problems. The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP's lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors, and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around 300 mln dlrs. One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on capital expenditure in the steel division, they said. They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900 mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from 1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit. REUTER 

SIEMENS SEES SALES NEAR 52 BILLION MARKS THIS YEAR

World group turnover of Siemens AG <SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said. Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02 billion marks. Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to 21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about 19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct. In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures. In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8 billion marks against the same 1985/86 period. For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion. Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the communications and telecommunications sectors in particular should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said. But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for 1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the dollar, Kaske said. Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the same period in the previous year. Turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology, communications and telecommunications sectors, but components and energy and automation showed a sharp decline. Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary. Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad was balanced by the decline in the dollar. While the installations and automotive technology sector showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and communications orders were below the level achieved in the same period of 1985/86. Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same level. Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to 6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover. REUTER 
KRUPP HAS SATISFACTORY 1986 RESULTS

The Fried. Krupp GmbH <KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory 1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to 18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year. Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5 billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from 16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement. Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year. The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales. Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities. An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order figures. However, "all business sectors contributed to the positive results achieved in 1986," Krupp added, without giving details. Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9 billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of orders against 40 pct in 1985. Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11 member companies which comprise the core area of the group, rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said. The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year. Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said. The steel market weakened increasingly over the year, mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer industries. The difficult market for sections and flats of quality steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said. But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms. REUTER 

NORCEN SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987 EARNINGS

<Norcen Energy Resources Ltd>, 41 pct owned by <Hees International Corp>, said earnings and cash flow will improve in 1987, even if oil and gas prices remain at 1986 levels. The improvement will result from production increases, lower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and from operating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during 1986, the company said in the annual report. Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings, excluding a 20.1 mln dlr writeoff, declined by 58 pct to 50.0 mln dlrs from 119.7 mln dlrs in in 1985. Norcen's 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 204.9 mln dlrs from 228.9 mln dlrs in the prior year. It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was the most significant factor for Norcen's reduced performance. "While financial results are far from the previous year's record levels, it is clear that Norcen has withstood declining prices and remains financially and operationally strong," Norcen said. It did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast.

BP AUSTRALIA REPORTS 16.15 MLN DLR YEAR LOSS

The <British Petroleum Co of Australia Ltd> reported a 16.15 mln dlr net loss for 1986 against a 73.38 mln dlr profit in 1985 after sales fell to 2.27 billion dlrs from 2.94 billion. The British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> unit attributed the deficit to stock losses arising from the drop in crude prices in the first half, when it made a 119.93 mln dlr loss. It said government compensation, in the form of subsidies to refiners to partially cover stock losses, together with improved crude prices in the second half, enabled the group's oil business to make a modest pre-tax profit. BP Australia said it had not recommended a dividend. Commenting on the year's performance, the company said it suspended operations at the 60 pct-owned Agnew Nickel mine because of losses sustained from declining nickel prices. The results also included an 11.3 mln dlr extraordinary writedown on the value of the laid-up oil exploration drillship Regional Endeavour. BP Australia said it had sold its 33-1/3 stake in chemical maker <CSBP and Farmers Ltd> yielding an extraordinary profit of 18.9 mln dlrs and expected to finalise the sale of the 80 pct-owned <Kwinana Nitrogen Co> in the first half of 1987.

JARDINE MATHESON PLANS FOUR-FOR-ONE BONUS ISSUE

Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd <JARD.HKG> said it planned a bonus issue of four new "B" shares of 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two dlrs. A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total 1987 dividend of four cents per "B" share, while the "A" share dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a share. Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986 net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985. Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from 4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said. It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG>, Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan. He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a reorganisation, is "a long term investment and now stands at a level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset imbalance." Keswick said the issue of new "B" shares will give the group "the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which has been brought about through the group's recent restructuring." He said the new issue is pending approval from both the firm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price. The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation, with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to the new unit <Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two companies spun off from Hk Land -- <Mandarin Oriental International Ltd> and <Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd> -- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson. Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs last year, will become debt free after the restructuring. "A positive cash flow from operations and disposals, continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet," Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities. Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its general trading business in the Middle East in view of the continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said the operations would be profitable in the longer term. He said the firm's function "has evolved into one primarily of strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy." He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific regional board. He gave no further details of the change. Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at midday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it had fallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firm planned a rights issue. REUTER 
BHP SEES STRONG FOURTH QUARTER BUT LOWER YEAR NET

The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> said it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificant investment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but net will fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86 ended May 31. The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to 603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28 from 813.0 mln a year earlier. Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November 31, BHP said in a statement. Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of share analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs. BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1. The bonus is being made from reserves which will not qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of dividend imputation next July 1. The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP said. BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of dividend will be maintained on the increased capital. The level of future dividends will be influenced by the implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation, it said. As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in shareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate. BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln. BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new plant and some operational difficulties. The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said. The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term, reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of <Blue Circle Southern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown. REUTER 
MITSUBISHI MOTORS AUSTRALIA MAKES 19 MLN DLR LOSS

<Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd> (MMAL) reported a 19.64 mln dlr net loss in calendar 1986 from a 5.80 mln dlr profit in 1985 on turnover of 837.79 mln dlrs from 942.89 mln. MMAL, 99 pct-owned by Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> and Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.T>, said a tight market meant it had failed to recover 19 mln dlrs in costs sustained because of a weak Australian dollar. The company said its Magna car dominated its market segment with sales of 30,500 units against 26,900 in 1985. Total sales were 64,100, down 15,900. In addition, export of components to Japan increased with 15 mln dlrs invested in 1986 to expand output of aluminium cylinder heads to 26,000 per month from 6,000, MMAL said. Imported passenger car, light commercial and heavy vehicle sales suffered while local-manufacturing profitability was eroded by sales substantially below production capacity, it said. Australian car sales fell to 530,000 in 1985 from 696,000 in 1985, although MMAL said it lifted its market penetration to 12.1 pct from 11.5 pct. No dividend was recommended. REUTER 

THYSSEN SEES GOOD 1987 PROFIT DESPITE STEEL LOSSES

Thyssen AG <THYH.F> said it expects to post a good profit in 1987 despite anticipated losses in its mass steel-making operations this year. Managing board chairman Dieter Spethmann told the annual meeting the group was satisfied with profit developments in the first half of the 1986/87 financial year to September 30. The group's other three divisions -- specialty steel, capital goods and trading -- had made a profit so far in 1986/87, he added. Spethmann said income from associate companies had also been good in early 1986/87. In 1985/86 Thyssen's world group profit fell to 370.1 mln marks from 472.4 mln in 1984/85, reflecting costs linked to its steel operations. The company's dividend was an unchanged five marks. A Thyssen spokesman told Reuters that planned job cuts at subsidiary Thyssen Stahl AG would be higher than announced earlier. Total job losses by 1989 were now expected to total up to 7,800 against original projections of 5,900. Thyssen Stahl employs some 40,000 people. REUTER 

GALACTIC <GALCF> ADOPTS CONSERVATIVE ACCOUNTING

Galactic Resources Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs. As a result, the company retroactively charged all past exploration and related administration costs incurred on its properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984. Under the new policy, all future exploration and related administration costs will be written off to expenses rather than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said. Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results. The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely affect working capital position, future cash flows or the company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it said. Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other mine developments. Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the life of the mine and charged against future earnings. The change will also result in lower depreciation and amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces. Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000 ounces. Reuter 

BFG PARTIAL OPERATING PROFITS FALL SHARPLY IN 1986

Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F>, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mln marks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholder Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG <AMVG.F>, AMB, said. But total operating and extraordinary profits, including earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's own account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms, were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said. BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB's capital increase, which is to finance the insurance company's acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG. Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company, <Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from which AMB has acquired the majority stake. The bank has said its business last year suffered from the turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing concern Neue Heimat. AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to 50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus. The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from 981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the interest margin to 1.9 pct. A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from 188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this. The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised because of the continuing difficulties of some countries. Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount, rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln. BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in 1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for 14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners. BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01 pct of <Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9 pct of <BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and five pct of <Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linked to AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG. These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer agreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions. REUTER 

ARBED SEES NEED TO MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON COSTS

The recent deterioration in the steel market makes it important for Arbed SA <ARBB.BR> to maintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a statement. It reported that its competitive position had weakened considerably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pct cut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mln tonnes. Arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit, slightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks to lower raw material costs and prudent management, the company said. Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market deteriorate further, but the decision of the European Community to maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally, should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect. EC ministers have agreed to extend a quota production system while discussions continue on an industry plan for capacity reductions. Arbed said in current conditions, cost cutting efforts remain necessary to avoid any weakening of resources which have been built up over the last three years. REUTER 
BASF <BASF.F> SAYS 1986 RESULTS AFFECTED BY DLR

BASF AG said the volatile currency situation last year, particularly the fall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominated in marks and to price reductions for exports from domestic production. But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the group said it expected satisfactory business development over the next months. "At the moment we do not expect any extraordinary influences such as there were last year," it said. Orders in hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level. BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax profit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985. The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and forced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said. The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. In the parent company, the positive earnings development continued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to 1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover was balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in raw materials. In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47 billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell 8.5 pct to 18.72 billion. Turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors fine chemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved in those areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985. Results from these had been taken only partly into the fourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data. So far in the current year, the investment volume of the parent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986, BASF said, without giving concrete figures. REUTER 

CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS

Canada's major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said. American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing. Such action "would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian banks to do the same," Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters. "They (banks) like to appear to be conservative," said Pulcine, "and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not." Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp <CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks. "In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have to have the support of the other banks," said Meredith. Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify, "wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position." Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt. Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days. They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until late May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter ending July 31. <Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bank creditor, said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as non-performing. "I think that is just for the benefit of the public," Walsh said of Bank of Montreal's statement. Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans non-performing. They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income. "From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks will get the money," said Meredith. "My outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's earnings." Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3.80 dlrs for <Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in 1986; 4.30 dlrs for <Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25 dlrs for <Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with 2.23; 2.15 dlrs for <Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94, and 2.85 dlrs for <Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74. She forecast 1.90 dlrs for <National Bank of Canada> against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split. Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share, assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs. "If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share. But I don't see that as a likely scenario," Pulcine said. Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the Brazilian debt situation was so complex that "it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year." He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings. Reuter 
VENEZUELA PLANS METALS INVESTMENT FOR 1987-89

The Venezuela Guayana Corporation, CVG, which oversees the state steel, iron, aluminum and other industries, will invest 75 billion bolivars in new projects during 1987-89, CVG president Leopoldo Sucre Figarella announced. The investments will go to plant expansion, infrastructure and the extension of hydroelectric facilities in the mineral-rich Guayana region, south of the Orinoco river. Sucre Figarella told a news conference the CVG's 12 companies showed an overall increase of 120 pct in profits, which rose from 1.732 billion bolivars in 1985 to 3.926 billion bolivars last year. Among the best performers was steel company Sidor which earned 1.019 billion bolivars, the first time since 1978 Sidor turned a profit. The gain was made possible in part by the refinancing of 1.619 mln dollars of foreign debt. CVG's three aluminum companies also showed substantial gains. Interalumina, which makes the intermediate material alumina, had an increase in profits from 116 to 217 mln bolivars, Alcasa earned 487 mln bolivars, as compared to 1985's 412 mln and Venalum's profits rose by around half, from 1.042 to 1.504 bln bolivars. Meanwhile, the state iron company Ferrominera saw its profits rise from 156 mln bolivars in 1985 to 204 mln bolivars last year. Reuter 

WOODSIDE SAYS LOSS REFLECTS LOWER OIL PRICES

Woodside Petroleum Ltd <WPLA.S> said its 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil prices combined with a large tax provision. Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to 17.14 mln dlrs in 1986 from 8.73 mln in 1985, although group revenue rose to 220.84 mln from 173.50 mln. It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax credit but instead made a 10.04 mln dlr tax provision. This largely related to its <Vamgas Ltd> unit, non-allowable exchange losses and tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not recognised in the accounts. Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full year sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the Shelf project, against six month sales in 1985. Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas and liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit. Since the balance date Woodside has accepted a Santos Ltd <STOS.S> takeover offer for Vamgas. Woodside said a 92.8 mln dlr capital profit on the sale would be included in the 1987 accounts. It said it lifted capital spending on fixed assets to 269.6 mln dlrs from 178.3 mln, mostly on the Shelf project. REUTER 

It added in a statement that parent net profit rose to 288.2 mln marks in 1986 from 221.7 mln the prior year. A Commerzbank spokesman noted the figures were,however, preliminary and required approval of the bank's supervisory board which meets today. The Commerzbank statement added the distributable profit last year rose to 228.2 mln marks from 161.7 mln in 1985. With inclusion of the corporate tax allowance, qualifying domestic shareholders would receive an effective dividend of 14.06 marks per share. Total dividend payout would rise to 186.8 mln marks from 142.0 mln on 1985 earnings due to the increase in the dividend and in equity capital, it added. From the parent net profit, 60 mln marks would be placed in published reserves, unchanged from the two prior years. The shareholders' meeting take place on May 22 in Hamburg. The statement said holders of Commerzbank participation certificates in a total nominal value of 425 mln marks would receive the remaining 41.4 mln marks of the distributable profit. Aside from the basic payment of 8.25 pct of nominal value, certificate holders would receive an additional 1.5 pct. The management board of the bank would also propose two capital measures to shareholders in order to be able to react quickly to new challenges. It would ask for authorised capital of a nominal 200 mln marks for the issue of new shares and for 300 mln for the issue of warrant bonds, both for the period until April 30, 1992. REUTER 
HUTCHISON ANNOUNCES BONUS ISSUE OF NEW "B" SHARES

Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <HWHH.H> announced a bonus issue of one new "B" share of 2.5 H.K. Cents each for every two existing ordinary shares of 25 cents a share par value. A company statement said Hutchison forecast 1987 dividends for existing shares of not less than 32.5 cents a share and not less than 3.25 cents for each "B" share. Hutchison said the new issue will help increase flexibility when it is planning future expansion moves or making acquisitions without affecting the existing control structure of the group. "The move will provide long term stability to ensure continuity of overall control of the Hutchison group in that it provides Hutchison with a stable framework within which management, development and the planned growth of the group's businesses can take place," it added. Hutchison shares lost one dlr to end at 53 dlrs each today. REUTER 

MANNESMANN SEES DIFFICULT YEAR FOR CAPITAL GOODS

Mannesmann AG <MMWG.F> expects a difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief executive Werner Dieter told a news conference. Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer nations. Domestic business was also declining and orders for West German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986, Dieter said. Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986. Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started last year, were now having an effect. Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter said had become one of Mannesmann's "strategic aims." He said the company's drive to combine activities in mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "plus point" for Mannesmann. Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks. It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar and lack of demand for steel pipe. Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this year. REUTER 
ESSO MALAYSIA REPORTS HIGHER PROFIT IN 1986

Esso Malaysia Bhd, a unit of Exxon Corp of the U.S., Reported net profit of 70 mln ringgit from its petroleum and ammonia operations in 1986 compared with 48.7 mln in 1985. Chairman Gerald F Cox said the improved performance was mainly due to product prices falling more slowly than crude prices during the year. He added that total sales volume increased as a result of higher offtake by affiliated companies, while inland market sales were maintained at around the previous year's levels. But growth prospects in 1987 remained weak and 1986 results are unlikely to be repeated in the current financial year. REUTER 

CANADA'S AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER

Canada's airline industry, shaken up by a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said. "Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada," said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. "Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market." The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week as Canadian Airlines International Ltd. Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the 6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's 50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine pct. Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd. They said CP Air's management style had been not much different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because neither airline was held accountable to its owners. "Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line," said Bradley. "But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air Canada is on the verge of going that way," he said. CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than profits, was "a perennial money-loser," analyst Wilfred Hahn of Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report. Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs. Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more than 2 billion dlrs. Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more attention to finances, analysts said. It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit "in excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs" for 1986. However, this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said. Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year, attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors. For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from cost-cutting and careful spending. Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain. "The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else's," Friend said. Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year. Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm. It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft. Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later, already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie. Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the Boeing Co. Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet, needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without hurting profits. Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8 mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western. Reuter 

DOME PETE<DMP> TAKES 2.08 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN

Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier profit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs. The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses, the company said. "The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses much of the progress the company has made in the two previous years," Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement. "But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome," chairman Macdonald said. "It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the company's assets in today's economic environment, and the absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued existence," he added. Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs. Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan. Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining period of the loans to which they apply, it said. Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20 billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in the third quarter. Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. The company said it previously determined a write down of conventional oil and gas properties was not required at September 30, under the previous method of calculating the limitation of oil and gas values. Dome said the most significant accounting change under the new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in calculations instead of escalating price forecasts. Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude the company from making an accurate estimate of future financing costs, which are used in the new accounting calculations, it said. As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10 pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said. Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71 billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs. Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue. Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also contributed to the decline, it said. Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79 pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985. Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago 542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0 mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs. Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and improvements in productivity. Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of lower domestic and export sales, it said. Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled 86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year. Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day from 591.0 mcf a day.

COMMERZBANK SEES LOWER OPERATING PROFIT THIS YEAR

Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986. In the first two months of the year, partial operating profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account - declined, he said, without giving details. The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of 1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly. By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased. German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this. Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, "we were able to raise the full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly." He gave no concrete details but added that in January and February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure. The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in future, developing, for example, more into investment banking, keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets. Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume. Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2 billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added. Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15 billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged. In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56 pct despite pressure on credit rates. The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said. Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct to more than 650 mln. As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks. Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985. Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a "high two-figure million" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG <AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F> during the latter's majority stake purchase booked last year. The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior years, to its full extent. Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further. Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks. "This means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default," he added. Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems. All banks had significantly strengthened their capital base, most European banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties. He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of interest in direct investment via an equity participation in Latin America, particularly from West German firms. Reuter 

THYSSEN SEES UP TO 20 PCT LOWER SALES IN 1986/87

Thyssen AG <THYH.F> expects a fall of between 15 and 20 pct in consolidated turnover in 1986/87, chief executive Dieter Spethmann said. He told journalists the exact decline would depend on dollar developments. The Thyssen group did over 50 pct of its business outside West Germany. Spethmann made no comment on 1986/87 group earnings. World group net profit fell to 370.1 mln marks in the year ended September 1986 from 472.4 mln a year earlier on group sales which fell to 40.00 billion marks from a previous 44.32 billion. Last week Spethmann told the annual meeting Thyssen expected to post a good profit in 1986/87 despite expected losses in the mass steel-making operations this year. Spethmann said engineering turnover would not be lower this year, but lower steel prices would result in a drop in steel turnover and sales volume. This would also affect Thyssen's trading operations, he said. Spethmann also categorically denied a magazine article published this week which spoke of a dispute between him and Heinz Kriwet, management board chairman of Thyssen Stahl AG, over planned job cuts in steel plants in the Ruhr area.

DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987

Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> has seen a slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference. Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78 billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion. Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank's own account, not included in partial operating profits. Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest surplus in a section current earnings from securities and participations. In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from 1.45 billion. As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits. But it said that total operating profits, including own account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the parent bank. Banking analysts said this put group total operating profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank operating profits at over five billion marks. Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its unchanged 12 mark dividend. The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986, and developments so far this year showed that was correct, Christians said. West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits. The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a high level of risk provision, Christians said. Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in 1986 from 765 mln in 1985. Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily reflect the full amount of risk provisions. Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985 because of the fall in the dollar. He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of such problem country debt had been written off. Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of "other securities," to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the parent bank. Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due to its increased activity in international share placements, with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international placement last year remaining on its books. Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to place these shares and conclude the original placement. Reuter 
SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH

Singapore's major banks are diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from loans to debt instruments, banking sources said. The banks following the trend are the <Overseas Union Bank Ltd>, <United Overseas Bank Ltd>, <Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation> and the <Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>. The shift towards securitisation has been helped by volatile financial markets which have developed hedging facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun. Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are switching from term lending to major growth areas such as stockbroking and fee based income, he said. Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now moving into the new government securities market and the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System. One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity market in Singapore. Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has increased business transactions and provided long term growth for the market. The banks are not competition for individual stockbroking firms because of the increased business they generate, he added. Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because of the increasing ability of foreign and local market participants to absorb new issues. Loh said <OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors seeking capital growth through a diversified international portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said. <DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm. Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be forced to provide fund management services for major clients seeking better returns, he said. Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from treasury and investment banking activities. They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986. Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40 mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said. The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in 1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by <National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary of the bank, they said.

Bayer world group 1986 pre-tax profit 3.30 billion marks (3.15 billion) - official



BAYER CONFIDENT OF POSTING GOOD 1987 RESULTS

Chemicals group Bayer AG <BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987 after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986. The company said that this was despite the mark's further strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and despite an increase in competitive pressure. "The further progress of our business will depend largely on the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy costs. Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15 billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72 billion from 1.62 billion. The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985 results, up one mark from a year earlier. Bayer said that world group operating profit declined slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed a further improvement. Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to 40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark. Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought pressure on selling prices, it added. In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against 1985, the company said without giving details. "The western Europe, North America and Far East regions developed well in local currency, but here too the translation of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture, especially in the case of North America," it said. Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in 1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks. Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986, resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset falling prices and cost increases in other areas. The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income. Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw materials all developed well, it said. Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period. Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower. Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985. REUTER 

The company reported its 1986 profits were 44 pct lower at 154.6 mln guilders than in the year before. Turnover was 18 pct lower than in 1985. The main reason fo the fall in turnover was the lower rate of the dollar, the company said. The lower costs for raw materials and energy, resulting from the lower dollar, could not compensate the fall in revenues.

WESTLB LUXEMBOURG REPORTS LOWER 1986 NET PROFIT

Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale <WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB International SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6 mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier. WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier. The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of 1987 developed positively, it added. WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in 1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks. Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from 10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new lending. The statement said WestLB International's business with private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year. This development was aided by cooperation between the bank and the savings banks in the West German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based. Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of 1.1 billion. WestLB International said it plans to expand its range of services for private clients. REUTER 

GERMAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SEES LOWER PROFITS

West Germany's chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said. Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG <BAYG.F>, told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices. Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986. The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said. Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs. Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact. Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany. The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East. Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct. Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year. REUTER 
WESSANEN FORESEES STRONG PROFIT GROWTH

Dutch dairy and general foods manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV <WESS.AS>, said it is planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong profit growth over the next 10 years. Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987 first quarter profits to show an increase. The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985. This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's guilder value, van Driel said. Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985 level of 3.20 guilders. Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders. US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover, compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide. Van Driel said the company would continue an active takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit. He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China. He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln guilders and would if necessary make new share issues. Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln dlrs. He said <Balanced Foods> and <Green's Dairy>, taken over late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs which was not included in the 1986 account. All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13 pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to this growth was the successful introduction of new products, which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US acquisitions, van Driel said. Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986 turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said. The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich, Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said. Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles for the company to raise capital for future expansion. He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in foreign hands. The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step, van Driel said without elaborating. Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said. REUTER 

CONSOLIDATED-BATHURST SEES BETTER MARKET

(Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said it expects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the second half of 1986 to continue this year. The continued improvement would be due to good market demand, better product prices and high operating capacity, the company said in its annual report. Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of 104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar, B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute to equity earnings. Last year's results were up from 1985 operating profit of 80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs. The company said it views its near-term prospects with improved optimism. It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the U.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity and production and more favorable market conditions. It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987 for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2 mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, and expects higher sales and earnings for its other North American packaging divisions. Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa Carton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputes between the United States and the European Economic Community on the West German economy and the higher value of the mark may lead to increased costs which could not be offset by price increases.

CITIBANK NORWAY UNIT LOSES SIX MLN CROWNS IN 1986

Citibank A/S <CCI.N>, the Norwegian subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years. Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices. Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in Norway since 1985. Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year. Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel. Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's <CMB.N> subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking. REUTER 

Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd <JARD.HK> said it will withdraw the previously announced four-for-one bonus issue of "B" shares and replace it by a two-for-five bonus issue of ordinary shares. A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded capital. Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a joint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, and Securities Commissioner Ray Astin, that the listings of new "B" shares would be barred. The official announcement said this will include the proposal by Jardine Matheson. But the Jardine statement quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying: "We continue to believe that the issuing of "B" shares would benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage." Keswick said the "B" share issue will benefit Jardine Matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue ordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting existing shareholders' voting rights. However, he added: "We certainly welcome (the Secretary for Monetary Affairs) David Nendick's referral of this very important matter to the Standing Committee on Company Law Reform and are hopeful that the process will lead to the development of general principles which can be embraced by all constituents of the Hong Kong market."

Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud. A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the company's new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality.

HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION

Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration. Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders, after 265 mln in 1985. Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986, said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters. The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S., Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe, where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total. Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders. Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery <El Aguila S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing, Heineken said. Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year. Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "We have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important point," van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures. "The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market, but how we are to do it," van Schaik said, adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very regionalized. Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term. He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there. Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales. On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities. To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which had sold successfully, Coebergh said. Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility, but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor," Coebergh said. Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced. But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western money. Reuter 

PHILIPPINE TELEPHONE FIRM PLANS STOCK SPLIT

The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co <PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters. Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the company's common stock from 10 to five pesos. He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18 mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15 1987. "The exercise should make our stock more marketable," Lazo said. "Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors." PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February 1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila Stock Exchange. Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15, would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15. PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68 pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985. At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders. A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax from which it was previously exempt. The government has not so far ordered the implementation of the tax decision. PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014 telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments in the country. In Manila item "Philippine Telephone firm plans stock split" please read in page 3, first para, "the company's profits are likely to be substantially cut" (inserting dropped word).

CCF REPORTS 34.8 PCT PROFIT BOOST, SHARE SPLIT SEEN

Credit Commercial de France <CCFP.PA> reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its denationalisation around the end of this month. Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets, planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad. Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was nationalised by the Socialists in 1982. The sources said it was too early to give details of the planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a likely date for the flotation launch. So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33 mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to ten shareholders before the flotation. The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday. "The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients," CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters. Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisation at between four and five billion francs. De la Serre said the bank was likely to attract at least the same number of investors as <Sogenal>, another recently privatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares. The government's sweeping privatisation programme has also included the sale of Saint-Gobain <SGEP.PA>, and Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA>. The sale of <Banque du Batiment et des Travaux Publics> and <Banque Industrielle et Mobiliere Privee> should be completed this month, while third largest French bank Societe Generale <SGEN.PA> will be privatised later this year.

NATNED FORECASTS 1987 RESULTS IN LINE WITH 1986

The Netherlands' largest insurer Nationale Nederlanden NV <NTTN.AS> (NatNed) said it expected at least unchanged results in 1987 after reporting 1986 net profits up 5.3 pct to 635.5 mln guilders from 603.4 mln in 1985, Revenues increased by 0.5 pct to 17.35 billion guilders after 17.27 billion the previous year, and the dividend was raised to 2.50 guilders per share from 2.38 guilders in 1985, corrected on a capital increase. The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressured by falls in exchange rates, particularly in the US and Australian dollar and sterling. Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher, NatNed said. The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986 compared with 52 pct in 1985. The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln guilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences, tighter interest margins and increased investment. Claim payouts fell to 9.9 mln guilders after 66.6 mln the previous year. The company's total assets reached 69.87 billion guilders in 1986 against 67 billion the year before. Assets per share equalled 65.68 guilders against 65.53. Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher, NatNed said.

AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS

Dutch insurer AEGON NV <AEGN.AS> reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits for 1987. Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred. Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly due to its life insurance business. Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks. Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss. In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities. AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances. This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments, resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders. AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague. In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat. Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these costs and made only a small contribution to the group's profits. AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill for Monumental Corp. AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December 1986, against 3.46 billion the year before. REUTER 

VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES

Losses for Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW spokesman said. The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business, despite the provision. One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit." VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company. VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed. VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice. Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders. VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares. The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly less than three billion marks. REUTER 

Moore Corp Ltd expects 1987 profits from continuing operations will exceed 1986 results and recover to 1985 levels when the company earned 152 mln U.S. dlrs or 1.70 dlrs a share, president M. Keith Goodrich said. "We'll have a substantial increase in earnings from continuing operations," he told reporters after the annual meeting. He said he expected profits would recover last year's lost ground and reach 1985 results. In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to 139.5 mln dlrs or 1.54 dlrs a share. The total excluded losses of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations. Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for acquisitions related to its core areas of business forms manufacturing or handling. "We could do a large acquisition," he said when asked if the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this purpose. Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder's question, told the annual meeting that a special resolution passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred shares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided to pursue an acquisition. "If we were to make a major acquisition ... it means we can move with a certain expediency," Sinclair said. Asked if the resolution was designed to give Moore protection from a possible hostile takeover, Sinclair said only, "I know of no threat to the corporation at this time." Reuter 

Wholly-owned Mobil Corp <MOB> unit, <Mobil Oil Australia Ltd>, reported a 38.63 mln dlr net loss in 1986, a turnaround from its 37.25 mln profit in 1985. The loss reflected a combination of strikes plus scheduled and unscheduled refinery shutdowns for maintenance and inventory losses caused by government controls on both crude and product prices, Mobil said in a statement. However, equity-accounting of associates' profits reduced the loss to 24 mln dlrs against a 37 mln profit in 1985. Mobil said it was confident 1987 would see a return to profit as it built further on its 1985 company restructuring. REUTER 
ANZ BANK SETS ONE-FOR-TWO BONUS ISSUE

Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> said it will make a one-for-two bonus issue from its asset revaluation reserve to shareholders registered June 2. The proposed bonus and an increase in authorised capital to one billion one-dlr par shares from 600 mln will be put to shareholders for approval at an extraordinary general meeting on May 26, the ANZ said in a statement. The issue will absorb about 230 mln dlrs of the 260.9 mln standing in the asset revaluation reserve, it said. The bank said that by lowering the dividend rate it expects to maintain the value of dividend payout on the enlarged capital at about the level of its last full year ended September 30. The group paid 31 cents a share and 133.1 mln dlrs in all for that year. Shareholders will also be asked to approve changes in the bank's articles of association to allow it to offer shares in lieu of the interim dividend at a discount of five pct to the market price. The group is the latest to announce a tax-free bonus issue ahead of dividend imputation, effective July 1. REUTER 
