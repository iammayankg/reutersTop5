ICO PRODUCERS TO PRESENT NEW COFFEE PROPOSAL

International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing countries will present a proposal for reintroducing export quotas for 12 months from April 1 with a firm undertaking to try to negotiate up to September 30 any future quota distribution on a new basis, ICO delegates said. Distribution from April 1 would be on an unchanged basis as in an earlier producer proposal, which includes shortfall redistributions totalling 1.22 mln bags, they said. Resumption of an ICO contact group meeting with consumers, scheduled for this evening, has been postponed until tomorrow, delegates said. Reuter 
ICO EXPORTERS TO MODIFY NEW PROPOSAL

International Coffee Organization (ICO) exporters will modify their new proposal on quota resumption before presenting it to importers tomorrow, ICO delegates said. The change, which will be discussed tonight informally among producers, follows talks after the formal producer session with the eight-member producer splinter group and will affect the proposed quota distribution for 12 months from April one, they said. The proposed share-out would still include shortfall declarations, they said. Reuter 
PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS

Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world"s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers "want to have the ball only in their court and it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either, they said.

IRAN CLAIMS NEW VICTORIES NEAR BASRA

Iran said its forces had captured one of Iraq's strongest fortifications east of Basra on the Gulf War southern front in a major battle overnight. The Iranian National News Agency, received here, said Iranian forces smashed four Iraqi brigades, killed or wounded 1,500 Iraqi soldiers and destroyed 45 enemy tanks and personnel carriers. IRNA said the Iranian troops seized one of the strongest Iraqi fortifications and breached Iraqi defence lines southwest of Fish Lake, 10 kilometres (six miles) east of Iraq's second largest city of Basra.

COFFEE QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, NO ACCORD SEEN LIKELY

The International Coffee Organization (ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute. The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement, delegates said. The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in September, they said. The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates said. Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter.

QANTAS TO BUY FOUR 747-400'S FOR ONE BILLION DLRS

<Qantas Airways Ltd> has placed a firm order with Boeing Co <BA> for four 747-400 aircraft at a cost of 250 mln Australian dlrs each, chairman Jim Leslie said. The first is due for delivery in April 1989 with the others arriving in May, June and September of that year, he said in a statement. The 400 series is the latest model of the Boeing 747 family, he said. The purchase will take government-owned Qantas's 747 fleet to 28, he said. Leslie said Qantas is talking to three engine makers who are all offering engines for the Boeing 747-400 and it will announce a decision on engine purchases later this year. He said they are United Technologies Corp <UTX> unit <Pratt^M and Whitney>, General Electric Co <GE> and Britain's <Rolls-Royce^M Ltd>. He said the 747-400, which incorporates new technology such as extended wings with six-feet high winglets and enhanced electronics, should have its first flight next February. The 400 series has a designed range of 12,500 kms, 2,140 kms further than the current Qantas 747-300's, he said. The aircraft will be financed by foreign borrowings and foreign exchange earnings, and Qantas believes they will pay for themselves in four to five years, Leslie said. The 747-400 has a take-off weight of 870,000 pounds, up from 833,000 for the 300 series, and offers an eight pct fuel saving, he said. The higher range and payload means they will first be used on the route to Britain and Europe via Asia. They will also be used on non-stop flights between Sydney and Los Angeles. REUTER 

U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 800 MLN STG

The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.61 billion stg.

U.K. CONFIRMS JANUARY STERLING M3 RISE

The Bank of England said the broad measure of U.K. Money supply, Sterling M3, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1 pct in January after a 0.2 pct rise in December. The unadjusted year-on-year rise was 17.6 pct after 18.1 pct in the year to December. The narrow measure of money supply, M0, fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.6 pct in January, and rose by a non-adjusted 4.1 pct year-on-year, the Bank said. The figures confirm provisional data issued by the Bank two weks ago. In December, M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 1.4 pct and by a non-seasonally adjusted 5.2 pct year-on-year. The Bank said sterling bank lending grew by a non-seasonally adjusted 1.75 billion stg in January. This also confirmed provisional figures issued in February. The measure of private sector liquidity, PSL2, fell 0.2 pct in January, but after seasonal adjustment rose 0.6 pct, the Bank said. The Bank said the public sector contribution to the growth in Sterling M3 was contractionary by about 2.3 billion stg. Within this, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) showed a repayment of 3.7 billion stg, while the non-bank private sector's holdings of government debt fell by about 1.1 billion stg. There was a fall of 290 mln stg in notes and coin in January, a fall of 1.5 billion stg in non-interest bearing sight deposits, and a rise of 1.6 billion stg in interest bearing sight deposits, the Bank said.

ICO QUOTA TALKS CONTINUE, OUTCOME HARD TO GAUGE

Talks at the extended special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said. Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September, with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year, they said. Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely. Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said. No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today, delegates said. A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report, delegates said. Reuter 
CUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED

Cuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct shipments to its export markets, dealers here said. Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts. The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said. Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month. Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes. Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets, traders said. Reuter 

FUNARO REJECTS UK SUGGESTION OF IMF BRAZIL PLAN

Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro flatly rejected a U.K. Suggestion that his country seek International Monetary Fund help in order to facilitate debt negotiations with commercial creditor banks. Talking to reporters, Funaro said this attitude would not help resolve the crisis started when Brazil suspended indefenitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs in external debt on February 20. Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of European capitals to explain the motives of the Brazilian debt moratorium and to seek support for intiatives to improve capital flows between developed countries and third world debtor nations. Talking before his departure for Paris, he said there could be no question of Brazil adopting another IMF austerity plan after a similar package four years ago "put Brazil in a very big recession." "We had an IMF program - it simply meant export more and import less. We are not going to go the IMF," he said. Funaro was reactnng to a British statement following his talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, saying the U.K. Government had no part to play in what it viewed as a problem between Brazil and its commercial creditor banks. Britain also believed an IMF program would help along negotiations between Brazil and the commercial banks, the statement, which banking sources interpreted as an outright rebuttal of all Brazilian demands, said. "That was not my impression of the meeting," Funaro said; "But if the (British) answer is more or less like this, then that means nothing is helping to find a solution." Funaro stressed that his talks in Washington last week and in Europe this week were aimed at gaining official support to unblock lending from official credit agencies, rather than to deal with Brazils ties with commercial banks. "Since 1982, all official agencies have been closed to my country," he said. He said Lawson had made no commitments to support Brazil's efforts. Lawson would officially state his position when the two meet again next month for the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington, Funaro said. Stressing there was no binding time schedule for Brazil's debt problem to be resolved, Funaro said Brazil had not come to Europe with specific proposals to overcome the present crisis. "We didn't come here to make a cash-flow programme," he said, "We will have meetings at the IMF next month - let's see what happens." Neither did Brazil plan a major overhaul of current domestic economic policies, which Funaro said would likely lead to a five pct economic growth this year. "Over the past five years we paid back 45 billion dlrs and received 11 billion ... This is a very big effort," he said. "What we have to offer is our cooperation." Reuter 

U.K. RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY

Britain's gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said. The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments. This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise. The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest. Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion. Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a Treasury spokesman said. Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January, capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap. The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today. A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures, said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels.

LONDON OPTIONS MARKET SEES CONTINUED HIGH GROWTH

The London Stock Exchange's traded options market plans volume growth of at least 80 pct a year, and will more than double the range of options available by the end of 1988, options committee chairman Geoffrey Chamberlain said. He told a news conference that more options contracts were traded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market's existence. Chamberlain said the daily average volume of contracts traded in February this year almost tripled to 53,056 from 19,034 in the same month last year, and further rapid growth was expected. "We're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of 1988," said Chamberlain. These would correspond to the eligible constituents of the FT-SE 100 share index. Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be introduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc <SEHL.L> from March 4, and in Plessey Co. Plc <PLYL.L> from March 19. The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the United States for options trading. Forty-five equity options, two currency options, two government bond (gilt) options and an option on the FTSE-100 index are available at present. Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidate the London options market's leading position in Europe, especially important with French and Swiss equity options trading planned to start this year. "I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are conservative," one leading options analyst said, predicting continuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least the next year. He said much of the recent growth in options had come from inter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. But now the retail options market was beginning to take off. The market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted floor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been left almost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in the equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which have encouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading. Yesterday, the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor to equities trading altogether, and said it expected to make a final decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987. The floor space could be used for a purpose-built options market, but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the options market would need more than half of the available space. REUTER 
U.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

Export Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said. Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57. A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years. Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services. The department's annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg. Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports. The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at." "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing," Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients. He noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list. REUTER 

COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS

Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said. The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now it is time to go and sell coffee." But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said. Reuter 

JANUARY CRUDE OIL MOVEMENTS FALL SEVEN MLN TONS

Worldwide spot crude oil movements fell to 30.07 mln long dwt in February from 37.25 mln tons in January and 41.44 mln in December, London shipbroker Howard Houlder said. The decline mainly reflected a sharp drop in movements out of the Mideast Gulf, which totalled 7.4 mln tons last month against 11.65 mln in January. These included shipments to western options at 2.05 mln tons against 3.59 mln previously. Liftings from the Gulf to eastern options fell to 4.15 mln tons from 5.94 mln and those from the Gulf to other areas dropped to 1.2 mln tons from 2.13 mln, Howard Houlder said.

FRENCH WHEAT EXPORTS TO EC FALL

French soft wheat exports to other European Community countries fell 18 pct to 4.13 mln tonnes in the first seven months of the 1986/87 season to January compared with 5.04 mln in the same 1985/86 period, the French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) said. According to latest ONIC statistics, the main buyers were Italy with 1.89 mln against 1.63 mln in the same 1985/86 period, West Germany 480,450 tonnes against 717,689, the Netherlands 462,048 (532,299) and Belgium 417,887 tonnes (919,337). British and Greek imports of French soft wheat during this period were below year-ago levels.

U.K. OIL INDUSTRY SAID NOT PERMANENTLY DAMAGED

The U.K. Offshore oil industry has suffered from last year's collapse in oil prices but should not sustain any permament damage, Minister of State for Energy Alick Buchanan-Smith said. The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been most affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy committee. He noted, however, that oil companies were still spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production. He added that a report by the manpower services committee which said 14,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 should be seen in the context of a total workforce of 300,000. Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of 8.50 dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the previous November. They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last December's OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15 dlrs. Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting OPEC style quotas, noting that Britian is an oil-consuming as well as an oil-producing nation. Reuter 

IRAN REPORTS HEAVY FIGHTING IN IRAQI KURDISTAN

Iran said its troops repulsed heavy Iraqi counter-attacks and continued their advance through the rugged mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan in overnight fighting on the northern war front. Iran launched the new offensive, codenamed Karbala-7, on Tuesday night among the snow-capped peaks of the Haj Omran border area of northeast Iraq. The Iranian news agency IRNA, received in London, said the troops "continued their successful advance ... With more thrusts into enemy positions." It said "remnants of Iraqi Brigade 604 was shattered and 200 of its personnel killed or wounded." One battalion of the 25th Division's Third Brigade thrown into counter-attacks today suffered 70 pct losses, the agency added. Some 208 prisoners of war had been taken from the front. IRNA said the Iranian forces backed by heavy artillery fire were continuing to advance. No Iranian casualties were given. The area between Haj Omran and the Kurdish town of Rawandiz some 65 km inside Iraq was the scene of heavy fighting in 1983. Iran has backed dissident Kurds in the area in attacks on government positions and installations in northern Iraq. IRNA said the Iranian forces captured large amounts of munitions in the latest fighting. The Iraqis have made no comment so far on the Kurdistan fighting, or on advances Tehran reported yesterday on the southern war front east of the strategic Iraqi port of Basra. IRNA said today a group of its reporters visited newly-captured areas on the southern front and found the battlefield littered with the bodies of Iraqi soldiers and burnt military equipment. They quoted an Iranian soldier, Hamid Dehqani, as saying heavy rainfall during the past few days "had paralysed the Iraqi enemy from embarking on any action" against the attacking Iranians. IRNA referred to the "Fish Canal" -- the man-made Fish Lake -- made by the Iraqis as a defensive barrier on the eastern side of the Shatt al-Arab waterway. The agency yesterday said infantry and armour of the Revolutionary Guards had captured strong defences west of the canal in bitter fighting with Iraqi troops. REUTER 

U.K. FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 2.6 BILLION STG

Britain had a visible trade deficit of 2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official statistics show. Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln. For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984. Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday. The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion. In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg. The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO said. However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions, particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available. REUTER 

TANZANIAN RAILWAYS SECURE 25.6 MLN DLRS AID

State-run Tanzania Railway Corporation (TRC) has secured 25.6 mln dlrs aid from banks and European countries for a one-year emergency repair program, Transport Minister Mustafa Nyang'anyi said. Nyang'anyi told Reuters on his return from a World Bank sponsored donors' conference in New York that the aid would enable TRC to buy spares for 32 locomotives, overhaul 800 wagons and replace 67,000 sleepers over the next 12 months.

EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING

OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows. The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia. They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month. OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show. The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals. But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability to export as much as its quota allows. Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed. Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production. Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota. Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March. Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota. Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers. Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd. Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea.

BRITAIN SEEMS SET FOR NEW CASH ROW WITH EC

Britain appeared set for a new cash row with its European Community partners as evidence emerged that it could be much worse off as a result of new proposals to radically alter the way the EC is financed. Analysis by officials and diplomats of proposals released yesterday by the EC's executive Commission showed their full impact, were they in force this year, would have left Britain worse off by 545 mln European Currency Units. The proposals have to be agreed unanimously by member government after a debate expected to open next month. The Commission said they were necessary to prevent the EC from sliding once again into bankruptcy, and has described the current financing system as unfair and unacceptable. British dissatisfaction with the cost of EC membership has long been a source of friction, and diplomats said the proposals could well reopen the wound. This was despite a proposed correction of Britain's budget contribution to reflect its inability to take full advantage of the EC's farm subsidies system because of the relatively small size of its agricultural sector. Diplomats said although other nations such as Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands were certain to oppose elements in the system which could also substantially increase their own EC payments, the main opposition was expected from Britain. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has made clear in recent statements that she is not prepared to abandon the present system, under which Britain is refunded two-thirds of its net payments to the EC, unless a fairer system is devised. The diplomats said Thatcher was unlikely to consider the proposed system as fair. The Commission's proposals would base a state's contribution on its gross national product, which the commission says is a fairer measurement reflecting relative wealth. The main element of the previous system was a share of value added tax collected in member states. The mechanism to compensate Britain for its inability to take up a higher proportion of EC farm expenditure will have to be paid for by the other 11 states. The Commission has also proposed to end repayments to all states of a service charge paid to them for collecting customs duties on behalf of the EC. REUTER 
INDIA BOUGHT AT LEAST EIGHT CARGOES SUGAR--TRADE

India bought eight cargoes of white sugar at a buying tender this week but also gave sellers options to sell an extra eight cargoes at the same prices, traders said. Four international firms shared the business which gave each of them sales of two cargoes of Mar/Apr shipment sugar at 233 dlrs CIF and options on two cargoes of Apr/May. This brings recent options India has given traders to some 200,000 tonnes at fixed prices and makes future Indian purchases very dependent on price fluctuations, traders said. At 233 dlrs CIF the sugar sold this week was at a discount of up to 10 dlrs to current prices, some traders said. Reuter 
BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT

The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high. It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said. Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to. The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage. "They're really making the discount houses suffer," said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. "Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates." This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound. The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50. "If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget," said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow. However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains. There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said. An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year. Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar. However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether. The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there. Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan. They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington. The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. "But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England," he added. The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders. Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg. This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985. Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals. The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day. REUTER 

TURKEY SEEKING 100,000 TONNES SUGAR - TRADE

Turkey is holding a buying tender for 100,000 tonnes of white sugar on March 24, traders here said. The sugar is being sought for early arrival and will probably be met with April/May shipment sugar, they added. Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisement from Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnes of crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decrease the amount. Over the 1983/85 period Turkey each year has exported between 240,000 and 350,000 tonnes of whites to Iran and between 62,000 and 230,000 tonnes to Iraq. Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analysts said Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continue filling these export contracts, and may need to buy more. Last month London broker C Czarnikow estimated Turkish 1986/87 production at 1.42 mln tonnes raw value against 1.4 mln in 1985/86 and an average 1.76 mln in the previous three seasons. The semi-official Anatolian Agency recently quoted Turkish Minister of Industry and Trade Cahit Aral as saying Turkey would export 100,000 tonnes of sugar this year and import the same amount.

CADBURY REQUESTS STOCK EXCHANGE ENQUIRY

Cadbury-Schweppes Plc <CADB.L> said it had asked the London Stock Exchange to launch a formal enquiry into dealings in the company's shares in recent months. It said it believed such a move was in the best interests of shareholders following recent charges being made under U.K. Insider dealing laws about the shares. Last week, former <Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> executive Geoffrey Collier was charged with insider dealing in Cadbury shares. Collier resigned from the bank last year and was later charged with offences on deals in shares of AE Plc <AENG.L>. A Stock Exchange spokeswoman said she could give no specific details about the request. An investigation would be requested from the Exchange as it had access to the relevant dealing records. If it appeared that some offence had been committed details would be passed to the U.K. Trade Department, which had the power to bring charges under the Companies' Act. No spokesman for Cadbury was immediately available for comment. Reuter 
OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING

Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices. Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. "We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord," he said. "I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work," he said. Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures. Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said; "That could well be correct." Opec"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was "well below" its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures. But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd. The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd. Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1. Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said. Lukman said that some industry reports "may be correct" that in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota. He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude. However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks. "We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals," he said, adding that he expected it to go "up and up" even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria"s. The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products. Also, some of Venezuela"s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said. Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to "dangerous levels," they would eventually have to buy Opec oil. "When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on," he said. Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak. He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment. "At this time, we have to get our priorities right," he said. "The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades." But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said. Reuter 
BRAZIL'S FUNARO WINS FEW PROMISES ON EUROPE TRIP

Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro last night concluded this week's tour of European capitals having gleaned little in the way of concrete support from governments for his country's attempts to find a radical solution to its debt payments crisis. However, banking sources noted the existence of considerable sympathy for Brazil's position among most of its commercial bank creditors, manifested in the widespread belief that adopting a hard line could only exacerbate the problems while patience might pave the way for an eventual reconciliation. Brazil on February 20 unilaterally suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks, followed by moves related to around 15 billion dlrs of bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions. The action had been preceded by a significant deterioration in Brazil's balance of payments situation in the final quarter of 1986, along with a marked acceleration in inflation. Reserves had dipped to below four billion dlrs. Funaro and central bank president Francisco Gros last week visited Washington to explain Brazil's move to government officials and agencies. This week they have sought official support in the U.K., France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. They have now decided to extend their tour, flying on Sunday to Tokyo to talk to government officials, with a possible visit to Canada before they return home. Funaro and Gros have so far confined their consultations to government representatives, believing that problems with Brazil's 109 billion dlr debt call for a political solution. However, banking sources noted that their attempts to enlist the support of European and U.S. Governments had been met almost unanimously with advice to talk first to banks. This counsel has been coupled with emphasis on the need for Brazil to present to creditors a convincing economic programme, with U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also recommending an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), advice which Funaro subsequently rejected flatly.

U.K. OFFICIALS STUDY SALMONELLA/CALF FEED LINK

U.K. Officials are studying the possible link between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and the spread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, a Ministry of Agriculture official said. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine yesterday stated that the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol had been shown to be linked to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle. The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with the Department of Health and the Public Health Laboratory to investigate the whole subject of resistant strains of salmonella. "The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible effects on human and animal health," the official said. The government is also studying a recommendation from the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calves under 56 days old through markets.

BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES

This week's Bank of England resistance to strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct. But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources said. Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day. Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19. A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting. Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. "Even after this action over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking distance of that range," he said. Other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area. However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports. "If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they are, what's to stop it (going higher)," said John Cox, executive director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London foreign exchange market. Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped keep it below 1.60 dlrs. The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and 1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting. But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels. He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat. "If rates don't come down, the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling," he said. Most dealers agree there is a good deal of "hot money" being invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short notice. However, the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment. "The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and have to jack them back up again," said Richard Jeffrey, economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd. He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling, at least in the near term. However, most analysts are still looking for a full point about March 17, Budget Day. The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the Budget, said Temperton. The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets. "Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget. He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut," said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the equities arm of Mercury International Group. Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind. This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October. However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates. REUTER 
INDIA AGAIN IN MARKET FOR SUGAR - TRADE

India has called a fresh buying tender for up to four 13,000 tonne cargoes of white sugar on March 11, traders here said. The tender calls for one cargo of prompt sugar and two to three with March/April shipment sugar, or the same as the eight cargoes bought at a tender two days ago. That tender originally only sought two to three cargoes but resulted in the sale of eight. India also granted the sellers options to sell twice that amount at the same price but for April/May shipment. Depending on prices, traders said it would be likely for India again to buy more than the tonnage formally sought. Reuter 

FERRY DISASTER MAY RANK AMONG WORST TRAGEDIES

Fading hope for passengers trapped aboard a partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident could rank among this centuries' worst peacetime shipping tragedies. Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was no hope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the Herald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian coast last night. If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world's worst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with a freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the loss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued. The world's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was the sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives. The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914 when 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Ireland collided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada. The world's worst maritime disaster was in wartime that took 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff was torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30, 1945. In 1985, more than 200 were feared dead after two ferries sank near Dhaka, 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and 147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah. REUTER 

EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY

As a British government investigation got under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship. Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover. Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed. Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present. "Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened," he told BBC radio. As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called "RoRo" ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise. In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads. Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety standards. But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design. Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge. "As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability," he said. Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level. "If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship," he added. REUTER 

U.K. CREDIT BUSINESS FALLS IN JANUARY

New credit advanced by finance houses, retailers, bank credit cards and other specialist providers of credit slipped to 2.66 billion stg in January from 2.78 billion in December - but remained close to the average level for 1986's fourth quarter, the Department of Trade and Industry said. Of the January total, 1.15 billion stg was advanced on bank credit cards. On a three-month basis, total advances in November to January were 3.0 pct lower than in the previous three months. Within this total, lending to consumers fell by 6.0 pct and lending to businesses declined by 5.0 pct. At end-January 1987, the total amount outstanding was 24.07 billion stg, up from December's 23.77 billion stg and 3.0 pct above the total three months earlier, the department said.

PLESSEY TO SELL TELEPHONE SYSTEM TO COLOMBIA

Plessey Co Plc <PLY.L> said it had won a multi-million stg contract to supply Colombia with the System X digital telephone exchange, the first major export contract for the system. Company sources said the deal was worth about 15 mln stg. v A Plessey statement said the contract, awarded by the National Telecommunications Authority of Colombia, was won against competition from Telefon L M Ericsson AB, NEC Corp, Fujitsu Ltd and Italtel of Italy. "The award is regarded as a triumph for System X and a breakthrough in the South American market," it said. Plessey said the contract was one of the largest awarded by Telecom Colombia for the past 10 years and involved supplying 13 telephone exchanges including 68,000 lines. The award also includes transmission equipment for the interconnection of the exchanges and the existing system. The firm was actively marketing System X worldwide and contract negotiations in certain countries had reached an advanced stage, it said. Plessey shares were down 5p at 235p, having gone ex-dividend.

NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK CUTS BASE RATE

National Westminster Bank Plc said it has cut its base lending rate 0.5 percentage points to 10.5 pct today. National Westminster said it was responding to general easing in money market rates. Its move followed a signal from the Bank of England earlier this afternoon that it would endorse a half point cut in the base rate, a surprise move following its strong signals last week that such a move would be premature.

U.K. AGRICULTURAL FUTURES MARKETS TO MERGE

Three London markets which trade potato, soymeal and meat futures said they will merge to form a new Agricultural Futures Exchange. Legal advisers have been instructed to implement the amalgamation of the London Potato Futures Association, LPFA, the London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE, and the Grain and Feed Trade Association's, GAFTA, Soya Bean Meal Futures Association, SOMFA. No timetable was given. Members of the three exchanges have been consulted, Agricultural Futures Exchange secretary Bill Englebright told Reuters, and no objections have been raised to the merger. Three markets are involved at present but the new exchange could ultimately combine five markets. Discussions are taking place with the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange, BIFFEX, and the GAFTA London Grain Futures Market is considering the possibility of joining the other markets, market officials said. The BIFFEX board is expected to reach a decision on the merger at its meeting at the end of this month, after members are consulted at a meeting on March 16. The grain futures market also intends to consult its members soon, GAFTA director general James Mackie said. The aim of the amalgamation is to limit regulatory and administrative costs and achieve the recognition required under the 1986 Financial Services Act. This legislation requires a futures market to become a Recognised Investment Exchange, RIE, for trading to continue. Representatives of all the futures markets on the Baltic Exchange have been discussing the possibility of a single RIE structure since the beginning of the year. The new exchange now planned will apply to the Securities and Investments Board for recognition as an RIE "at the appropriate time," the Agricultural Futures Exchange said. "This commitment by the markets will enable progress to be made to develop a stronger and more effective exchange to the benefit of all those involved in the industry," the chairman of the formation committee, Pat Elmer, said. The merged markets will remain at the Baltic Exchange. Reuter 

The base rate reductions came after the Bank of England cut its dealing rates this morning in a signal to the money markets that it would not resist a half percentage point drop in bank base lending rates, market sources said. Until the end of last week, the central was holding out staunchly against market pressures for lower rates in an apparent effort to preserve the expected rate cuts for around the time of the government's annual Budget on March 17. Sterling remained firm around 1.59 dlrs compared with its close here on Friday at 1.5865 dlrs. REUTER 
U.K. ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE

The Bank of England said it was taking onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 "B." A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National Debt Commissioners. The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20 minutes after the news. Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's strength. The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures. However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut. Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling. Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage. Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market. To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains. Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's. However, they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT.

UK MONEY RATES FALL AS BANK APPROVES BASE RATE CUT

A half point cut in base lending rates was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of downward pressure, dealers said. During its routine intervention in the market, the bank trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct. The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17. For some time, fundamentals have led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow wholesale money market rates down. Although political considerations -- the government's wish to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank's delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling and perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of the Budget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealers said. In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut, leaving the market still looking for another half point fall. Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the day, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to 10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at 10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd's were similarly down between 5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year. Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at around 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at the end of last week. Today, overnight touched a high of some 11-3/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated 300 mln stg shortage. REUTER 

FERRY DISASTER CLAIMS COULD TOP 30 MLN STG

U.K. Insurers could face more than 30 mln stg of insurance claims following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, a spokesman for Lloyds of London said. It could take weeks before the extent of the compensation claims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also before it was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged, said David Larner of Lloyds. The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprise were valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by Townsend Thoresen's parent company Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc <PORL.L>. The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with Lloyds and various other companies, Larner said. Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the Standard Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of several shipowners' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were also underwritten by Lloyds and other companies. Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to total at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and the normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974 of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death. Shipping sources said, however, that these claims could soar if a court found there was negligence or design faults involved. Larner said estimates of compensation claims "were pure guess work" at this time. But if the ship could not be salvaged, the claims would total at least 30 mln stg. Shares of insurances on the London stock exchange fell across the board in a generally weak market. General Accident fell 21p to 936, Royal Insurance dropped 18p to 966 and Prudential fell 9p to 888.

LMFE TO CONCENTRATE ON CASH SETTLED CONTRACTS

The London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE, will cease trading in its deliverable pigmeat contract from April 3, the LMFE said. The move will enable the exchange to concentrate on the cash settled contracts introduced last year. "This allows the exchange and its members to concentrate our marketing on the pig and live cattle contracts," LMFE official Peter Freeman said. "These two have already shown their effectiveness for hedging, and the trade in both contracts is increasing," he added. "Using the futures market allows better planning and forward price fixing that our industry needs," chairman Pat Elmer said. Some 131 pig contracts were settled against the Meat and Livestock Commission's Average All Pigs Price in February, which represents hedging for over 13,000 pigs, more than twice the number cash-settled in January, the LMFE said. Cash settlement on the new cattle and pig contracts was introduced last June in the expectation that the appeal of the futures market to farmers, abattoirs and users of meat would increase because of the absence of a delivery requirement.

PRIMARY EUROSTERLING MARKET BOOMS DESPITE RATE CUT

Two new eurosterling bonds were launched today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria. The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in banks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments. "Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and we're set to see many more eurosterling deals," one dealer said. Today's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stg deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. "We thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down with 10 already," one eurosterling specialist said. "Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a cheap and attractive way to raise your money," he added. This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations. Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields. A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest. This is the first entry into the long term international capital markets by Storehouse, British designer Terence Conran's retail conglomerate which incorporates U.K. Chain stores Mothercare, British Home Stores and Habitat. "We have been considering the move for quite some time now and the current strength of the eurosterling sector provided the perfect opportunity and spur for us to finally tap the market," Lance Moir, corporate treasurer at Storehouse Plc told Reuters. 

TRADE SAYS EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO FORECAST

Traders here and in Paris said the results of today's EC white sugar tender are hard to forecast because of plans by a group of French, West German, Dutch and Belgian operators to sell one mln tonnes of sugar into intervention. London traders said bids for licences have been reported between 43.00 and 44.00 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licences are granted they are likely to be towards the lower end of that range, possibly 43.30/43.50 Ecus. Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates of between 43 and 43.50 Ecus. Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export, the likely tonnage is expected to be very small, the London traders said, while the French sources declined to estimate volume in view of the psychological impact of the planned sales into intervention in protest against EC export policies.

Thai sugar production totalled 960,788 tonnes in January, an increase of 12.7 pct on January 1986, according to figures received by the International Sugar Organization.

NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES

U.K. Interest rates look set to move lower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to 10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of a British National Savings issue yesterday. The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market. The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted. They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later. The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due 1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at 10-9-7/8 pct. It coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar. "That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed," said Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew; "It is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people hope for more." Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the National Savings Department was "of considerable significance." It said, "the real message ... Is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises." Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates. Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut. "National Savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late. Building society income has been depressed in recent months," he said. He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on U.K. Inflation. Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after last year's 3.7 pct. Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct. But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts. "The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the National Savings move reflects this," one senior dealer said. A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market. "We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just becoming too expensive and we don't need all that money," he told Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above or below market rates. He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31. In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg, compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the previous year, official figures show. Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the total for 11 months above target, government officials said. REUTER 

U.K. BANKS OFFER FIXED-RATE MORTGAGES AT 10.2 PCT

Two major U.K. Clearing banks announced they will offer a total of 800 mln stg in new mortgages at a fixed interest rate of 10.2 pct for the first three years, below current bank base lending rates of 10.5 pct. Midland Bank Plc <MDBL.L> said it has initially allocated 500 mln stg for home loans at this rate, while Lloyds Bank Plc <LLOY.L> will offer 300 mln stg. Earlier this week, Midland said it would cut its standard rate of mortgage payment to 11.5 pct from April 1, following a half a percentage point reduction in leading banks' base lending rates from 11 pct. Building society and other bank mortgage rates are largely still well above the new base rate level, although last year Lloyds offered a fixed rate of 9.9 pct on certain home loans. A Midland spokesman said his bank calculated that at the current level of 2.7 billion stg, its existing mortgage book accounts for about 5 pct of the total British home loan market. Lloyds said it has 3.6 billion stg in outstanding mortgage loans, but had not estimated its total market share. Among other major clearing banks, Barclays Plc <BCS.L> and National Westminister Bank Plc <NWBL.L> said they had no immediate plans to announce similar fixed rate schemes. Reuter 

U.K. RETAILERS SEE GROWTH IN CONSUMER SPENDING

U.K. Retailers expect consumer spending to accelerate in March after a disappointing increase in February, according to a monthly survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). Fifty-nine pct of the 325 retailers questioned for the latest Distributive Trades Survey expected sales to be higher in March than they were in March 1986, with only six pct expecting lower sales. The chairman of the Distributive Trades Survey Panel, Nigel Whittaker, said a favourable Budget next week would further help sales during the summer. Figures released earlier this week showed retail sales in January fell 2.2 pct, mainly due to exceptionally cold weather. "Sales did not recover in February as much as retailers had expected, and they are now looking for better business in March," today's survey said. It reported clothing stores were the most optimistic, with 80 pct expecting sales in March to be higher than a year ago. Wholesalers also expected stronger sales in March, while both retailers and wholesalers reported slower growth in import penetration, it said. REUTER 

"BRITANNIA" COIN TO SELL AT PREMIUM

The new British one ounce gold coin, the "Britannia," will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the day of purchase plus a "competitive premium," Treasury officials said. Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold Market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins. Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the place of the South African krugerrand, the British government still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold. Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases. No details are yet available on how many coins will be issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price. There were some enquiries on the "Britannia" from coin dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put off many investors, traders said. Some said that the "Britannia" had come too late, with the Canadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins already well established. Reuter 
LME CONSIDERING CHANGES TO CLEARING SYSTEM

A proposal the London Metal Exchange, LME, change its new clearing system, due to start May 29, was made today at a meeting of LME members and International Commodities Clearing House, ICCH, representatives. Amalgamated Metal Trading Ltd, AMT, proposed that a daily cash-cleared system common to all other markets should be adopted, rather than the system currently planned whereby prompt dates are settled when they mature. AMT claims the margin requirements for the latter will be costly. Opposition to the proposal came mainly from trade and industry representatives who, as traditional users of the Exchange's hedging facilities, said a cash-cleared system would be more costly for them. LME Board Chairman Jacques Lion said any major alterations to the planned new clearing system would have to be referred to the Securities and Investment Board, SIB, and this could be time consuming, bearing in mind the May 29 start-up. There was also a risk of the Exchange losing its greatest asset, its trade hedging business, he said. Lion accepted a proposal that, while clearing with the ICCH continue as planned, details of AMT's cash clearing system be circulated for consideration and discussion by LME Board, Committee and members for possible introduction at a later date. The LME also said that Japanese yen contracts will now be excluded from clearing as they are not used widely enough to warrant inclusion. Reuter 

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY

The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. "The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common," said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community. Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system -- the French franc, Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. "Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict. REUTER 

EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED

European sugar beet plantings are expected to show little change from last year, despite recent firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said. A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while, so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations. Trade analysts said their private reports give similar results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West German sugar statistician F. O. Licht. Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this. In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing starts to growing seasons. Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers will grow so-called "C" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area needed to meet the EC "A" and "B" quotas, which receive full and partial price support, respectively. Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week between producers and the EC commission over its export policy could have serious implications for future sugar output. Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices. However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point, this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future cut in the basic "A" and "B" quotas, they added. In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last year's 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year. "The basic trend is towards stability," a FIRS spokesman said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00 tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11. In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans, since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average. Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year. British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year's crop equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes. British Sugar has "A" and "B" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes of whites and its "C" output is due to improved yields from more consistent disease-resistant seed types. Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to increase the area above the already signed contracted level. The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in 1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes. World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers' association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but surveys suggest a drop from last year's 270,000 ha, especially in the north where some farmers have switched to soya. Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar. Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest Dutch sugar processor, said. The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes of white sugar and to cut output of "C" sugar. Last year, the Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar against a combined "A" and "B" quota of only 872,000 tonnes. "The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher than it has done recently to make planned production of "C" sugar really worthwhile," the spokesman said. Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year's Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year. Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some 95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic demand. The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year. A spokesman for Denmark's largest beet concern, De Danske Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha. In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB. Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987 plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down from 37,600 in 1986.

U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE

The Bank of England said it invited an early round of bill offers from discount houses after forecasting a shortage in the system of some 1.05 billion stg. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and treasury bill take-up will drain some 1.07 billion stg while exchequer transactions will take out around 335 mln stg and bankers' balances below target five mln stg. Partly offseting these outflows, a fall in note circulation will add some 355 mln stg to the system today. REUTER 

UK FEB RETAIL SALES RISE PROVISIONAL 2.2 PCT (JAN FALL 2.2 PCT) - OFFICIAL



U.K. RETAIL SALES RISE 2.2 PCT IN FEBRUARY

The volume of U.K. Retail sales rose a provisional, seasonally adjusted 2.2 pct in February after falling a final 2.2 pct in January, figures released by the Department of Trade and Industry show. The February sales index, base 1980, was put at a preliminary 125.0 after a final 122.3 in January. In the three months from December to February, the level of sales was little changed over the previous three months but was nearly six pct higher than the same year ago period. On a non-seasonally adjusted value basis, retail sales in February were a provisional 9.0 pct higher than a year earlier. The Department noted the latest figures were similar to the average in the fourth quarter last year but well above the January index, which was depressed by the effects of severe weather. The February trading period comprised the four weeks February 1 to 28. Final February retail sales figures will be published on April 6. REUTER 
COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS

The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government delegates and trade experts said. Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work. The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations. The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade. A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend. Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would "distort, not support" the market. Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices. The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the "must buy" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact, which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock. Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets. A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or selling operations, were carried forward from the previous agreement. Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes. The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters, and the full council meets on Thursday. Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member countries such as Malaysia. Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas. The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities. European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures market's existing differentials for different qualities. Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market. Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa. Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower. The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations. The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there. One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is "meant to support the market where trade buying is not." In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers. Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced "posted price" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers. In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.

U.K. AND GERMANY LEAD ATTACK ON EC FARM REFORMS

Britain and West Germany told their European Community partners they would strongly oppose major elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses. At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led protests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said. West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance other proposals that could hit German farmers, they added. They said West Germany's objections were put in a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the president of the EC's Executive Commission which had put forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC cash crisis. Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) - a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports. Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German farmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all other 11 EC states, diplomats said. Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it could seriously damage EC trade relations. The diplomats said the United States had been the most outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it as a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade body GATT. But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC, such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Iceland and Norway, they added. Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S. Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today, diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this month, they added. REUTER 
INDONESIA HAS IMPORTED PALM OIL, TRADERS SAY

Indonesia has imported palm oil this year and is likely to take more, trade sources said. They were commenting on a weekend Jakarta report quoting a Ministry of Trade spokesman as saying Indonesia had not issued licences to import the commodity. He also said there was no sign of a shortage of palm oil in Indonesia. A major palm oil dealer said he shipped Malaysian palm oil to Indonesia in February, additional vessels were loading this month and other vessels had been earmarked for April. Other operators claimed they had palm oil booked for Indonesia but would not disclose tonnages. Traders said palm oil production in Indonesia this year had been below expectations and current stocks were low. They said licences were issued at the start of the year to import crude palm oil but were subsequently revised to include RBD olein and RBD oil. Last week there were rumours in European markets that Indonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil for deliveries commencing April. An Indonesian Ministry of Trade official said this was incorrect. Some traders here said the total could be more. Others said they could include those issued earlier this year and applications not yet granted. Reuter 

COCOA CONSUMERS NARROW GAP ON BUFFER STOCK ISSUE

Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules, delegates said. While consumers do not yet have a common position, an observer said after a consumer meeting, "They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive." European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect, delegates said. At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules. The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month's meeting. The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said. The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa, delegates said. A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question. A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a consumer meeting. Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon. "We are waiting to see what consumers say," a producer delegate said. "We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate." The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non- members include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an increasingly important producer. Reuter 
U.K. BANKING HEAD RESUMES ATTACK ON CITY PREDATORS

The Governor of the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, repeated his criticism of City predators, describing them as "thoroughly irresponsible." "I have been concerned when predators have sought to use a minority shareholding to unsettle a perfectly well-managed company and to create an atmosphere in which a bid becomes daily expected," he said in a speech to the Industrial Society. "Such activity can amount to a thoroughly irresponsible exercise of shareholder power, and an abuse of the arrangements we have for the protection of shareholders' interests," he said. Leigh-Pemberton was resuming a theme he developed in a speech last week, when he attacked the practice of "putting a company into play." This is when predators use a minority shareholding to force a company's management into action which will raise the company's share price. The predator then withdraws, taking substantial profits. In today's speech, Leigh-Pemberton said it was hard to find the right tightrope to walk between intervention and adherence to a free market philosophy. REUTER 
TORONTO SUN EXAMINING POSSIBLE U.K. TABLOID

<Toronto Sun Publishing Corp> said it was examining an idea for a new tabloid newspaper in Britain after being being approached about the concept by a person in England it declined to indentify. "We were talking to this individual and offered to help him in effect formulate his concept and that is about as far as it has gone," Toronto Sun Publishing vice-president of finance Bruce Jackson said in reply to a query. "We have not decided anything," Jackson added. "It has not been brought to the board of directors for any kind of approval or heavy discussion." Jackson said that Toronto Sun recently produced a dummy newspaper for the individual to use in testing possible British market reaction. Toronto Sun publishes tabloids in Toronto, Edmonton and Calgary, Alberta and the Houston Post. Asked about possible financial or editorial support by Toronto Sun, Jackson replied: "It is far too premature to discuss anything like that." He said further developments were unlikely to unfold for "at least a month." Jackson described the British tabloid market as "very competitive, but it is a very large market as well. It most likely doesn't take a large market share to be profitable there as long as you find the right niche." He said Toronto Sun is approached almost every month about ideas for starting newspapers, mostly in North America, "as the Toronto Sun is known to be a newspaper group that has started papers. "Unfortunately, this one leaked out and it probably attracted a little more attention than it really deserves at this point," Jackson said. Toronto Sun recently dropped plans to start a second English language newspaper in Montreal, citing a study that indicated the lack of a sufficient advertising base for such a paper. Reuter 

ICCO TO EXAMINE BUFFER STOCK PROPOSAL TOMORRROW

The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and consumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine a draft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow, delegates said. ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what some delegates called a "pre-compromise" and present it to the buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday, they said. While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a buffer stock should be implemented, both sides reiterated they were willing to compromise to come to agreement, they said. "I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement -- maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in the session," a consumer delegate said. Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of ICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of various grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades, delegates said. Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be able to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price for the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin. Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the buffer stock should operate, with several countries backing different aspects of the producer stance, delegates said. The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until March 27. Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most controversial topic on the agenda, delegates said. Reuter 
EC AGREES ON AID PACKAGE FOR MEDITERRANEAN STATES

European Community (EC) foreign ministers have agreed on an aid package of loans and grants totalling more than 1.6 billion European Currency Units (Ecu) for states in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region. The five-year accord increases aid to the states, Tunisia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and Syria, by about 60 pct from the previous pact, Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans told a news conference. The EC's executive Commission had proposed a package of more than 1.7 billion Ecus, about 70 pct more than the last aid deal, but West Germany and Britain called for the rise to be kept to 30 pct. The package includes 615 mln Ecus in cash grants from the EC, while just over one billion Ecus will be made available in loans from the European Investment Bank, the EC's long-term investment arm. Details of how the money is to be distributed will be worked out by EC officials. Syria, while still officially included on the list, will not receive any money unless EC ministers specifically agree to it.

U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this year, Lawson said. "As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year," he added. Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg. On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88. No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate, he said. "But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate," the Chancellor told Parliament. Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 "is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular." On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. He said "it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position." Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future. "We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead," Lawson said. "Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course remains a major objective of government policy." "But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future." Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book. On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be charged at the "appropriate corporation tax rate." He said that under the new proposed system, companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains. "Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89," Lawson said. Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax, "with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due." "I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and File." This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection, and would not come into force until the early 1990s. Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred. Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field. On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers. Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received. Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21,300 stg. New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added. The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125,000 stg. Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but "genuine trading companies" will not be affected. He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from April 1. "In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan," he said. The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct. Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added "given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget." Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct, he said. On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders. The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said. "The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year," Lawson said. MORE 

Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement. Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was not immediately available against other development expenditure, the statement said. The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said. Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability. This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred, to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland Revenue said. This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs, it said. In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year, it calculated. The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech. These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation. Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called "ring fence" of activities in the U.K. And its continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November, it said. Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry. He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward. Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged, he said. Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year. He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin. This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south. He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year. REUTER 
ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE

British bank base lending rates are likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K. Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said. The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward. Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through, the analysts said. Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow. "This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get interest rates down," he said. Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half-point cut now. Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he, too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday, but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts. "This budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate. The implications for interest rates are very favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week," Simmonds said. Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target. "There is no real need to boost private consumption," he said. National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut. Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully, in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point base rate cut could be implemented. But providing the budget small-print was convincing, "and I suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week," Kern said. Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates. This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said. U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money and government bonds (gilts) markets. But building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point. REUTER 
ICCO GROUP LOOKS AT COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULE PLAN

The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said. The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said. The proposal involved three key principles. First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said. Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said. The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be set by a formula, the delegates said. After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said. Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from, one consumer delegate said. Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change. Reuter 
ANALYSTS SAY U.K. BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement. A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week. "Worthy but boring would probably sum it up," Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. "It was a very, very prudent fiscal budget." Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat. Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy. As was widely expected, Lawson split his "fiscal adjustment" between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct. The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped. Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately. Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full one-point cut tomorrow. "The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later," Jeffrey said, though he added a further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future. The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said. Holt noted the "rather loose" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern. "A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term," he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation. The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but it was "not a good budget for inflation," he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation. Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the "leading edge" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front. He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness. Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts. Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from 1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets, which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said. that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast to be 4.0 billion stg. But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election, which has to be held before June, 1988. Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately. But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it. James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent, Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no "chickens coming home to roost." Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory. Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity. REUTER 
BUDGET SEEN PAVING WAY FOR EARLY U.K. ELECTION

The budget presented by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was described by MPs and analysts as being politically astute, combining tax cuts and fiscal prudence which promised to boost the Conservative government's standing with both voters and financial markets. The 1987/88 budget contained a two-penny cut in the standard rate of tax, and a three billion stg reduction in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), to 4.0 billion stg. Parliamentarians said the budget would pave the way for a fall in domestic interest rates and an early election. Conservative MP Anthony Beaumont-Dark said the budget "is not glamourous - but it is sound and sensible." Lawson told journalists later that it was "a budget built on success, for success." But opposition MPs did not agree . David Steel, leader of the Liberal Party, said "this was a strangely deceptive budget. The Chancellor had six billion stg to give back - he has chosen to give half of that to reducing the PSBR, whereas we in the SDP/Liberal Aliance think it would have been wiser to use those revenues to reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty." Steel said "the cunning thing in this seductive budget is that all the good things will come in the pre-election period - the fall in interest rates, the fall in mortgage rates, the lower income tax, relatively cheaper whisky, beer, cigarettes and petrol." David Owen, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) which with the Liberals make up the centrist Alliance grouping, said "this is a good attempt at an electioneering budget but it has failed in its objective. It has given money to the "haves" as opposed to the "have-nots." Labour leader Neil Kinnock called it "a bribes budget." Kinnock said the budget "had little to do with the general good, and everything to do with the general election." Roy Hattersley, the Labour Party's Treasury spokesman, said "the Tories should have used available resources to invest in industry, in health and in education." He added that "we know that whoever is elected (to power in the next general election) will reverse these tax cuts." But Lawson rejected that. Rather, he said the Treasury expected to have at least 3.0 billion stg in fiscal 1988/89 for use in cutting taxes or raising public spending. Lawson rejected claims by opposition MPs that the government would be forced to call an election by a deteriorating economy. In his financial statement to Parliament, Lawson had said that "the setting for this year's budget is more favourable than it has been for many years. We are now entering our seventh year of steady growth and the fifth in which this has been combined with low inflation. The public finances are sound and strong, and unemployment is falling." He said that "these are the fruits of the government's determination, in bad times as well as good, to hold firmly to our policies of sound money and free markets." Lawson later said the Government felt no compulsion to plump for an early election. Asked by political journalists what effect the Budget would have on election timing, he replied "I think we will hold the election either late or early. I must confess I am rather relaxed about it all. "There is not any compulsion to go for an early election. But he added that "if the Prime Minister decides to go for an early election, it will bring to an end all this rather ridiculous pre-election atmosphere and fever - and there is something to be said for that." Industry also welcomed Lawson's budget. Confederation of British Industry (CBI) President David Nickson said "This budget will reinforce business success. Lower government borrowing means lower interst rates for business. This is what the CBI wanted." "We have always said we would judge the budget on how it affects the cost of borrowing. This should do the trick." REUTER 
U.K. OIL REVENUE FORECAST TO FALL IN 1987/88

The U.K. Government forecasts that oil revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year 1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in 1985/86. The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament. The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15 dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining close to current levels, the Treasury document said. The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation tax is paid after a time lag. The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full year. Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987, according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88 and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added. Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the 1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts, despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts. Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the overshoot. Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to 168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items, besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of 40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year. Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5 billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in 1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion, compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this fiscal year. The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised 164.9 billion in the current year. A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in 1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury said.

UK TRADE WARY OF HIGHER EC GRAIN LEVY

The European Community may decide to increase the cereals co-responsibility levy and extend its scope to cover cereal substitutes if the Commission's 1987/88 farm price package is opposed by member states, Edgar Pye, vice-president of the British agricultural merchants' association UKASTA, said. At the moment the Commission is proposing the rate of levy remain unchanged at three pct - but Pye, addressing a feed manufacturers' dinner in Glasgow, said this could change if its controversial plans to cut cereal prices and introduce an oils and fats tax are blocked Pye said UKASTA would continue to fight the cereals levy "tooth and nail." However, a test case in the European Court of Justice contesting the legality of the current regulation applying the levy, which is being backed by the EC feed manufacturers' organisation FEFAC, was not now expected to be heard until the end of 1987, he said.

"I would be very surprised if there is not a very early further fall in interest rates," Lawson said in a radio interview. Analysts said they foresaw U.K. Base rates falling as early as today by as much as one full percentage point after Lawson's announcement yesterday that the public sector borrowing requirement in fiscal 1987/88 and 1988/89 was to fall to 1.0 pct of GDP, or some four billion stg.

STOLTENBERG URGES U.K. ENTRY INTO EMS

West German finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg suggested that the U.K. Should join the European Monetary System (EMS) and also urged some member countries to abandon their dual currency structures. Stoltenberg was speaking at a meeting of the Committee for a Currency Union in Europe, whose key members are former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, founders of the EMS. He said, "One failing of the EMS is important countries, like Great Britain, are not members. Other partners should give up their split currencies or abandon broader fluctuations." EMS member Belgium has both a "financial" and a "commercial" franc and the Italian lira is allowed to fluctuate by six pct against other member currencies, compared with a permitted fluctuation of only 2.25 pct for other currencies. According to a text of Stoltenberg's speech, the finance minister also urged greater convergence of economic and financial policies among European countries. He added that monetary stability should be a priority for European countries and, with reference to the U.S. Dollar, he said it was wrong to presume that a "permanent devaluation" was the answer to economic problems. Stoltenberg said there were clear reasons to bring down the dollar in 1985. "But an overshooting in the other direction now brings the danger of a new inflationary push for the U.S. And other countries whose currencies have declined," he added. He said such a development could also produce further burdens for heavily indebted developing countries. An agreement last month in Paris by industrial countries to stabilise the dollar around current levels had acknowledged these risks, he said. REUTER 

LAWSON HAPPY WITH STERLING, BACKS LATEST RATE CUT

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut in British bank base lending rates to 10 pct. However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly. He told a briefing of economic journalists that "I don't think we should rush anything." Lawson stressed the themes of "gradualism and steadiness" as economic policy. Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of GDP. Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines, were "perfectly consistent" with monetary conditions now in Britain. He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply aggregate was "safely inside" its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3. Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS), Lawson repeated that "it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election." He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS membership under constant review. But he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls. Although Lawson denounced what he said was "the current wave of election fever" in Britain, he added: "It is more likely that there will be an election this year" than not. He said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air. "Ideally, we (the government) should have a full term," but events could force a premature poll, Lawson said. The government, which has been in power since 1979, must call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either a June or an early autumn election, political sources said. The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88 "was the right balance, economically and politically," he said. Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move. But it was being praised today by political analysts as a shrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate. Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg. Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson stressed that "they are not an objective (for the government) - they are an instrument of policy." Consequently the Treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said. But "there may be interest rate consequences" from changes in the level of government borrowing, he added. Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in Britain. He said conditions created by London's role as a leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries. Three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in Britain, Lawson said. First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest rates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets. He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party. Thirdly, he said "we do not have as long a track record of low inflation" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany. Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminent financial centre, because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than New York or Tokyo. REUTER 

U.K. BASE RATES WILL FALL AGAIN SOON, SAY ANALYSTS

Today's modest half-point cut in U.K. Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said. They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant. Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg. Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading. Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year. But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt. Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates. "Today's cut was slightly disappointing," said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. "The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget." Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time. The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term. Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again. "The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being," said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds. "But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long." Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday. Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said "There is another half point to come in the near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks." Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange rate. Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately. Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances of re-election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988. Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial targets. With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's Marshall said "Sterling is simply the best game in town, especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong."

COPPER INDUSTRY ASKS LME FOR STRATEGY STATEMENT

Representatives of the International Wrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers have told the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of its forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between industry and the LME. In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which will retain the prompt date settlement basis. Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change (the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental change in the function of the LME and in its service to the industry, the release said. By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from non-trade orientated markets such as Comex. The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should take a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industry delegates said. The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on May 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be given in due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week. A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of review and change, the press release said.

CZARNIKOW EXPECTS LOWER EUROPEAN SUGAR OUTPUT

European sugar output on the basis of three year average yields will be over half a mln tonnes white value down on last year although yields do vary widely from year to year, broker C Czarnikow said in its market review. European Community sowings are likely to be down compared with last year. There have been suggestions these sowings might respond to the recent upsurge in world prices, but Czarnikow said "it is not the sort of fact that easily becomes known." The broker bases its forecasts on Licht planting estimates which put W Germany, the Netherlands and USSR lower but Hungary, Romania, Poland, Turkey and Yugoslavia higher.

CUBAN SUGAR OUTPUT SEEN AT 7.5 MLN TONNES

Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87) is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikow in its monthly sugar market review. Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year's domestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for export of which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will be taken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries and the remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations. Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75 mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export needs of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to be acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date may not be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said. Reuter 

The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 450 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 650 mln stg while a rise in note circulation will take out around 30 mln stg.

U.K. CLEARING BANK LENDING RISES 1.6 BILLION STG

Clearing bank sterling lending to the U.K. Private sector in February is estimated to have risen by an underlying, seasonally-adjusted 1.6 billion stg after a 1.2 billion stg rise in January, the Banking Information Service said. The unadjusted rise was 1.31 billion stg, compared with an 813 mln stg increase in January. The Banking Information Service said the adjusted rise of 1.6 billion stg was well above the recent monthly average of about 1.0 billion stg. Of the increase, 297 mln stg was accounted for by personal lending, which the Banking Information Service said was taken up entirely by lending for home purchases. Lending for consumption fell around 17 mln stg while about 182 mln stg of credit card debt was repaid during the month. Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg, and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg. The Banking Information Service said February fell within the governmemnt tax season, so much of the lending was probably the result of industry's need to pay its tax bills. Deposits by the private sector rose an unadjusted 1.1 billion stg in February and by a seasonally-adjusted 1.75 billion stg. Deposits from the public sector rose 185 mln stg in February while deposits from overseas residents rose by 43 mln. REUTER 
U.K. UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS IN FEBRUARY

Unemployment in the U.K. Fell a provisional seasonally-adjusted 44,100 in February, to total 3.07 mln or 11.1 pct of the workforce, the Employment Department said. In January, seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by a revised 1,100 to 11.3 pct, it said. Initially the January position was reported as flat. The unadjusted jobless total, including school leavers, fell to 3.23 mln, or 11.7 pct, from 3.30 mln, 11.9 pct, in January. February was the seventh successive month that seasonally adjusted unemployment registered a fall. It was at a peak of 11.7 pct last summer. Lord Young, the Employment Minister, said there appeared little doubt the monthly fall, which has been running at about 20,000, will continue. A Department spokesman said the sharp fall in February reflected some compensation for the flat figure in January and continued the downward trend seen in the past six months. He said the February fall was spread throughout the country and among men and women. REUTER 
STERLING M3 UP 2-1/4 PCT IN FEBRUARY, M0 DOWN

The main measure of U.K. Broad money, sterling M3, grew a provisional, seasonally adjusted 2-1/4 pct in February after a rise of 1.1 pct in January, the Bank of England said. The narrow measure, M0, fell a provisional adjusted 3/4 to one pct after a 0.6 pct drop in January, the Bank said. Unadjusted annual growth in sterling M3 was 18-3/4 to 19 pct in the 12 months to February against 17.6 pct in January while M0 rose four to 4-1/4 pct after a 5.2 pct rise in January. Seasonally adjusted, sterling bank lending grew 2.9 billion stg after a January rise of 1.75 billion. Of the unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3, bank lending to the private sector expanded 2.6 billion stg after a 1.4 billion rise in January, the Bank said. The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) contracted by 300 mln stg after a contraction of 3.7 billion stg in January. Funding - debt sales to the non-bank private sector and external flows to the public sector - rose by 300 mln stg after a 1.5 billion stg rise in January. Of this, central government debt sales to the public sector were expansionary by 400 mln stg after a 1.3 billion expansion in January, the Bank said. Other unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3 expanded by 300 mln stg in February after an expansion of 1.3 billion stg in January, the Bank said. Unadjusted figures showed a rise in sterling M3 by 1-3/4 to two pct in February after a drop of 0.8 pct in January. On the same basis, the figures showed a drop of about 1-1/2 pct in MO in February after a sharp 6-1/2 pct fall in January. The Bank said it would publish full, final figures on March 30. The Bank said non-bank private sector holdings of public sector debt fell by about 400 mln stg in February while external flows to the public sector were about 100 mln stg. Combined with a net PSBR repayment of about 300 mln stg, the public sector contribution to the growth in sterling M3 was therefore about flat, the Bank said. It said seasonally adjusted bank lending, at about 2.9 billion stg in February, compared with an average of about 2.6 billion stg a month over the preceding six months. REUTER 
U.K. EARNINGS RISE 7.6 PCT IN YEAR TO JANUARY

U.K. Average earnings rose a seasonally adjusted 7.6 pct in the year to end-January after a 7.4 pct rise in the year to December, the Department of Employment said. The underlying rise was 7.5 pct after 7.75 pct in December. The January index, base 1980, was set at a provisional seasonally adjusted 190.4, down from 193.4 in December. The underlying rise, adjusted for factors such as back-pay and timing variations, had been steady at 7.5 pct from October 1985 to October 1986. Unit wage costs in U.K. Manufacturing industry rose 3.3 pct in the three months to end January, on a year-on-year basis, after a 3.1 pct rise in the three months to end December, the Department of Employment said. In January, the unit wage rise in manufacturing industries was 3.6 pct, unchanged from the December rise. The Department said the decline in the underlying rate of rise in earnings reflected the reduced significance of bonus payments in January compared with December. The actual increase reflected teacher pay settlements and industrial action in the transport and communications sectors in January 1987. REUTER 

COCOA DELEGATES OPTIMISTIC ON BUFFER STOCK RULES

Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said. Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving. "The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week," Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists. Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations "optimistic and realistic." The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January, with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs. The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices. Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations. The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates said. Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme. The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates said. During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast delegation gave "an open minded statement" that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible, Baron said. Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday to attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place. Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council session because of a conflicting International Sugar Organization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon, delegates said. Reuter 

EC APPROVES 680 MLN STG U.K. AID TO ROVER GROUP

The European Community (EC) Commission said it approved a 680 mln stg British government aid package to state-owned Rover Group Plc <BLLL.L> to restructure and privatise the group's bus and truck subsidiaries. In a statement, the commission said Rover's <Leyland Trucks> subsidiary would be financially and physically restructured following a recently announced merger between Leyland Trucks and <DAF> of the Netherlands. The Commission said government aid for this program was justified because it would contribute to Europe-wide rationalisation of the truck sector. The amount of aid approved is slightly below the 750 mln stg the British government had planned to grant Rover by writing off accumulated losses and other costs. The Commission said there was overcapacity in the European truck industry estimated at between 25 and 40 pct. It said its approval of the aid also took into account the consequences for jobs and for the regions affected by the restructuring. Under EC rules, the Commission has to approve all government aid to industry. REUTER 

SOVIET TIMECHARTERING BOOSTS GRAIN FREIGHT RATES

Current interest by Soviet charterers in taking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. To carry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recent surge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange (BIFFEX), dealers said. Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today for the first time in the spot position since the market opened in May 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with values some 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which is calculated on spot physical rates. No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about 50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which would normally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said. "It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect on its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported," one said. Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route have subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering conditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left for the remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risen steadily for vessels loading next month. Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering taking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand. Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business later in the year, they said. They anticipate this would appear around June and it has prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite it normally being a slack time in the shipping year. Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Rates turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which had supported the market at the start of the year, faltered but then recovered on the reported Soviet interest. Reuter 

The index, Britain's measure of inflation, is for February. Earlier data will not be revised as there are no equivalent figures including the new components, a spokesman said. Previously, the RPI base was January, 1974. Market forecasts centre on a 0.4-0.5 pct monthly rise in February and a year on year rate about 4.0 pct.

EC MAY OFFER INTERVENTION SUGAR TO LOCAL MARKET

Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review. The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the intervention price, with detrimental consequences for producers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar. The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time limit on storage contracts, which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September, Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced. If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price, the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says. The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy, Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules. The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price, Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission's hand. In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price, West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the "green" mark. Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC's export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it says. The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says, suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of "unnecessary bureaucracy" surrounding the export tender system.

U.K. MONEY DATA MAY EASE RATE CUT, ANALYSTS SAY

Slower than expected growth in Britain's narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a further cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling's value requires such a move, economic analysts said. M0, the only targeted money supply measure left after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February. On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2 pct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct. "The M0 data are much better than we expected," said Robert Thomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities. He and other analysts said while the better than expected M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new interest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move. Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pct after a fall of the same size in January. Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates. "The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is important ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tune," Lloyds Merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment. Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett, said in a comment: "It is unlikely that (Lawson) will respond to signals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken." "With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable, the City has been forced to take it seriously," he added. Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared. This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K. Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets, analysts said. Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at their Paris meeting last month, they added. U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the Paris agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget. They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half-point in the coming week. Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than expected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct. Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on March 31. Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling M3 target, and Lawson's move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as a key factor in monetary policy.

UK CROSS FIELD PRT RELIEF FAVOURS SMALLER FIELDS

The "cross field allowance" relief on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co. The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval. A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field. "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said, adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced. The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax, the report said. On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said. In a study on probable fields, the report said that when the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct. The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost. Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time. Reuter 

"I think there was a time that they (British manufacturers) thought the (exchange) rate was uncomfortably high. But I think they are very satisfied with the present level." "But I have made it absolutely clear that I don't want to see the pound go through the roof," he added. Reuter 

INTERNATIONAL SUGAR PACT TO BE RENEGOTIATED

The International Sugar Agreement (ISA) will be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization (ISO) officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a special session of the pact's council. A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO six monthly session in May.

But delegates said the latter would only be considered if the world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba and the European Community -- can resolve differences over how prices can best be supported and how to share the world Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlier indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of the ISO budget. At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would try and find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later this year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO 800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full contribution in the last year of the current pact. The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a single category of members who would all share the costs pro rata to their share of world sugar trade. The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the next full council session in the week of May 19. There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO. Reuter 
U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE

The Bank of England said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after forecasting a shortage of around 950 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain around 572 mln stg while a rise in note circulation wil take out some 280 mlns stg.

U.K. AVERAGE GDP RISES 2.6 PCT IN 1986

Britain's gross domestic product (GDP) on the average basis of output, expenditure and income rose by 2.6 pct in 1986 after a 3.4 pct increase a year earlier, Central Statistical Office (CSO) preliminary figures show. In the fourth quarter, GDP rose 0.7 pct over the previous quarter and was up 3.3 pct on the same 1985 quarter. The average estimate index, seasonally-adjusted and based 1980, was set at 114.3 in the fourth quarter of 1986 against 113.5 in the previous quarter and 110.7 in the final quarter of 1985. The CSO said the average GDP estimate index for 1986 as a whole was 113.1, up 2.6 pct from 110.2 for 1985. On the output measure, GDP rose an upward revised seasonally adjusted 0.3 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 to 114.9 on the output index from 114.5 in the previous quarter, giving a 3.2 pct rise over the fourth 1985 quarter, the CSO figures show. On income-based GDP, the index in the fourth quarter rose by 0.7 pct from the third quarter and was up 3.8 pct on the year-ago quarter. The indices stood at 115.3, 114.4 and 111.0 respectively. Expenditure-based GDP rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 from the third quarter and was up 2.9 pct from the same 1985 quarter. The CSO set the expenditure index at 112.9 from 111.6 in the third quarter of 1986 and 109.8 in the final 1985 quarter. The year-on-year rise for expenditure GDP was 2.3 pct with the expenditure index for the whole of 1986 set at 111.9 against 109.4 a year earlier. For income GDP, the year-on-year rise was 2.6 pct against against three pct a year earlier. The ouptut GDP measure rose 2.8 pct year-on-year, down from 3.8 pct in 1985. The government usually considers the output measure the most reliable way of measuring short-term GDP changes. It is based on output data for production industry and partial information for the rest of the economy. The government had forecast that average measure GDP would rise 2.5 pct in calendar 1986 after 3.3 pct in 1985. The budget unveiled on Tuesday foresaw GDP growth in 1987 of three pct. The GDP deflator, based on expenditure at market prices, rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter from the third, to give a 2.4 pct rise over fourth quarter 1985. Year-on-year, the deflator rose 3.7 pct.

U.K. RETAIL PRICES RISE 0.4 PCT IN FEBRUARY

The Retail Price Index (RPI), Britain's measure of inflation, rose 0.4 pct in February on a revised basis, to give a year-on-year rise of 3.9 pct, the Employment Department said. In January, the index rose 0.4 pct for a 3.9 pct year-on-year rise on both the previous base and the new index. The February RPI was set at 100.4, base January 1987. In February 1986, the RPI rose 0.4 pct, giving a 5.1 pct year-on-year increase on the old basis. The inflation data compares with market forecasts for a rise of 0.4 - 0.5 pct in February and a yearly rise of about four pct, economists said. The Employment Department said the rise in the index between January and February was mainly the result of higher prices for petrol, fresh vegetables, cars and car maintenance. REUTER 

LCE AND IPE TO INTRODUCE TIME-STAMPING

The London Commodity Exchange (LCE) and International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) are to introduce revised trading slip systems incorporating the time that futures business is executed, an LCE spokeswoman said. The LCE's six week trial system starts on April 1, with buyers and sellers filling in slips which carry not only the transaction, but also the date and time of execution. These slips will then have to be forwarded to market staff for entering into International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) terminals within 15 minutes of the trade being transacted, the spokeswoman said. The IPE system is similar, although here traders will use time-stamping machines which automatically enter the date, as is the practice on futures exchanges in the U.S. And on the London International Financial Futures Exchange. Time-stamping of U.K. Futures business becomes mandatory later this year under the Financial Services Act, to meet the Securities and Investments Board's requirement on audit-trails, the LCE spokewoman said.

PRESSURE BUILDS ON THATCHER TO CALL ELECTION

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came under fresh pressure for an early election today as financial indicators bolstered the government's forecasts of a boom in the economy following the budget earlier this week. Two of the country's leading lending institutions announced cuts in home loans rates following Wednesday's cut in interest rates by the main banks by half a point to 10 per cent. Analysts said today's reduction by Abbey National from 12.75 pct to 11.25, and one by the Halifax Building Society from 12.25 to 11.25 in lending rates for house buyers would be followed by other main institutions. One financial analyst commented: "I imagine the Abbey National is being toasted in Downing Street (the prime minister's residence) but not in the boardrooms of other big societies." Coupled with income tax cuts announced by Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Nigel Lawson in his budget last Tuesday as well as recent opinion polls showing Thatcher's rightwing Conservative Party well ahead of Labour and the centrist Alliance, they said pressure was now building up on Thatcher to call a general election as early as June. Yesterday there was more good news for Thatcher in the form of a continuing drop in the number of unemployed, with government minister predicting that it would fall below the three million mark before long.

UNIQUE EXPORT FINANCING BEING ARRANGED FOR MEXICO

A single purpose company, <Italfunding Ltd>, has been created for the purpose of obtaining funds on the international capital markets to refinance 44.3 mln dlrs of Mexico's official debt to Italy at very attractive rates, Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd said as lead manager and arranger. The transaction will be accomplished by Italfunding obtaining a 44.3 mln dlr euronote facility in the market and then using the proceeds to provide a loan for the same amount to Mexico. The loan will be 100 pct guaranteed by SACE, the official Italian export credit agency. Morgan Grenfell has used special purpose vehicles in the past to help refinance export credits for other indebted countries, such as Brazil and Ecuador. The Brazil financing, for example, involved the use of a floating rate note. This transaction makes use of another sector of the capital markets -- that for short-term note facilities -- to finance a medium term credit. The financing is being arranged in connection with a bilateral agreement between Mexico and SACE earlier this year to refinance Mexico's official debt to Italy. The bilateral accord followed a multilateral rescheduling agreement reached last September of Mexico's official debt to the Paris Club of western creditor governments. The Paris Club accord, in turn, was part of a broad-based rescheduling package covering 77 billion dlrs of Mexico's foreign debt. That package -- heralded as the first to incorporate all aspects of U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's plan to aid indebted countries -- included a 7.7 billion dlr loan, which was signed today in New York. The new financing for Italfunding, being syndicated among about five major international banks, will be a fully underwritten, revolving facility with an average life of seven years and the facility will fund the loan. All Paris Club agreements contain a generally accepted outline for a rescheduling, but the specific terms must then be negotiated on a bilateral basis. Banking sources noted that the use of a special-purpose vehicle will provide Mexico with particularly attractive financing at a rate of about 1/4 to 1/2 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor). The cost of the new financing compares with a spread of 13/16 pct on the loans in the new commercial bank package. This is because the intermediary providing the funds, in this case Italfunding, can obtain its funds relatively cheaply on the international markets. At the same time, the deal benefits the banks, which will still get a reasonable return on the note facility, which is pure Italian risk. The bankers noted that if the financing had been arranged in Italy, the cost to Mexico and the Italian banks would have been higher since the Italian banks would use a different source of funding.

SAUDI ARABIA'S KING FAHD VISITS BRITAIN THIS WEEK

King Fahd of Saudi Arabia begins a four-day state visit on Tuesday which will focus on redressing Britain's large trade surplus with the kingdom and reaffirming ties between the traditionally close countries. British officials said King Fahd may ask Britain to restore diplomatic relations with Syria, broken off by London last October after evidence in the trial of Nizar Hindawi showed Syrian agents were behind a plan to bomb an Israeli airliner. But one official said the king would be told Britain still needs "clear and sustainable evidence that the Syrians have renounced state-sponsored terrorism. So far they haven't." Britain will stress its support for an international peace conference on the Middle East and its concern over alleged human rights abuses by Israel in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, the officials told Reuters. The Saudi leader will hold talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and meet Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip during the visit, his first to Britain since he assumed power in June 1982. King Fahd will be accompanied by his trade, defence, oil and health ministers, who will hold talks with their British counterparts. Relations between the two countries have generally been warm. But they were strained last year by the deportation of 35 British nurses from the kingdom for illegal drinking and the publication of a letter by a retired British ambassador describing Saudi Arabians as incompetent and arrogant. Saudi Arabia is Britain's largest export market in the Middle East. Britain exported 1.5 billion stg worth of goods to Saudi Arabia last year while British imports from that country in the same period totalled 436 mln. Trade officials will discuss what countertrade Britain can offer in return for Riyadh giving London its biggest-ever arms export order. Under the five billion stg deal signed last year, Saudi Arabia has agreed to buy 132 warplanes including 72 Tornado fighters. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer is likely to discuss oil price stabilisation but Britain would not change its refusal to limit its North Sea oil production and exports, officials said. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has asked all oil-producing countries to help stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel by curbing output and exports. King Fahd's trip follows several visits to Saudi Arabia by British officials in recent months. Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana went to Saudi Arabia in November. There were two previous state tours of Britain by Saudi monarchs. King Faisal visited in 1967 and King Khaled in 1981. REUTER 

NIGERIA OPENS TALKS WITH U.K. TO RESCHEDULE DEBT

Representatives from Nigeria are meeting today and tomorrow with officials of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) in the first of what could be a series of bilateral talks to reschedule Nigeria's official debts, banking sources said. The talks follow an agreement reached between Nigeria and the Paris Club of western creditor governments in December to reschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of medium and long-term debt due between September, 1986 and end 1987 over 10 years with five years grace. Nigeria's official debts to the U.K., Its major trading partner, are estimated at 2.5 to three billion dlrs. If the talks prove successful, the Nigerian team, headed by Finance Minister Che Okongwu and Central Bank Governor Abdulkadir Ahmed, will hold similar talks with French export credit officials in Paris later this week, the sources said. An agreement could pave the way for ECGD to resume insurance cover for exports to Nigeria, which was suspended in 1983. The rescheduling of Nigeria's official debts was one of the demands required under a rescheduling of part of the country's estimated 19 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, for which agreement also was reached in December between Nigeria and a steering committee representing the commercial banks. The commercial bank rescheduling has yet to be finalised because of the reluctance of Japanese banks to participate in the agreement, despite a recent trip to Japan by senior Nigerian officials and representatives of the steering committee. The entire package also is being held up because of the need to reach an agreement to satisfy arrears due on short-term insured and uninsured debts. However, bankers are hopeful that an accord will be struck by May 31. The Nigerians also are attempting to reconcile creditors' claims with their own receipts on some two billion dlrs of letters of credit contained in the commercial bank rescheduling. Bankers said that it was hoped that the ECGD would resume cover fairly soon as this could encourage other official creditors to begin bi-lateral talks as well. Under the structural adjustment program supporting the debt reschedulings Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export credits this year from official export credit agencies. British exports to Nigeria were 565 mln stg in 1986, down from 960 mln in 1985, while Nigeria's exports to Britain, which do not include oil, were 328 mln stg and 647 mln, respectively. REUTER 

TIN COUNCIL WINDING-UP VERDICT APPEALED

Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today lodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its petition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC. The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22, when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the collapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985. AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal. The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on three points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters. The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points. The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold said. The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling. The court originally decided that the winding-up petition went wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT spokesman said. The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a receiver appointed over the ITC's assets. Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be consolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said. Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the Council's member states and an application by the governments to strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11. Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin "ring-out" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the near future.

SOVIET CLAIMS TO BE TREATED EQUALLY - ACCOUNTANTS

All claims to be settled under a U.K./Soviet pact agreed last year in connection with pre-revolutionary Russian bonds and seized assets will be treated equally, Price Waterhouse and Co (PW) said. It said that the treatment for the bonds had not actually been determined, although it had been estimated that holders would receive about 10 pct of the nominal value of the bonds, which was the percentage to be assigned to property claims. Now, "the face value of the bond will be added to the value of the property. A dividend will then be calculated and all claims will be treated equally," PW said. PW administers the Russian Compensation Fund, which was set up by the Foreign Office in 1917 to oversee some 45 mln stg in pre-revolutionary reserves for claimants of assets seized during the Revolution. PW, which is currently accepting applications for the claims, said that to date, 2,000 bond application forms and 600 property application forms have been returned. Because the number of applications and bonds returned is increasing rapidly, a special office where the claims are being processed will remain open beyond the close of business until midnight on March 31, the deadline for claims to be submitted.

U.K. PROFITTED FROM AUTUMN INTERVENTION - LAWSON

Britain has reaped profits by using a stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He said in a parliamentary debate, "I can now tell the House (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds." Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said. The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point. During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week, he said that "during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for." He said that that one percentage point increase, effected in October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two half point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct. Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and October 1986, government sources said.

British manufacturers expect output to grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey shows. The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47 pct said production would likely remain unchanged. The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was the highest such figure recorded since 1977. In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop. The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal. This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said. In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct respectively. Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels. In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct, the proportion of companies rating their export books above normal was unchanged between February and March. On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in February. From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expect prices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall, against four pct a month earlier. Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committee chairman David Wigglesworth said sterling's more competitive level against many European currencies had improved exports. "But interest rates are still much higher than in our competitor countries and British manufacturers will still have to work hard to win new business both in overseas markets and in the substitution of British-made goods for imports here at home," he said.

U.K., AUSTRALIA OFFER WHEAT TO BANGLADESH

Britain and Australia have offered a total of 129,250 tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh as grants to contain rising cereal prices and help support rural employment projects, officials said. They said 79,250 tonnes of wheat promised by Britain would be shipped next week and used for the government's "Food for Work" program in the villages. Under the program, workers building roads, digging irrigation canals and engaged in other rural development activities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money. The 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive in Bangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operations designed to stop price increases, the officials said. Prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in the past month, market sources said. But the government expects prices to fall after the wheat harvest next month. REUTER 

U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 300 MLN STG

The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 300 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 338 mln stg while bankers' balances below target will take out around 25 mln stg. Partly offsetting these outflows, a fall in note circulation and exchequer transactions will add some 45 mln stg and 25 mln stg to the system respectively. REUTER 
BARBADOS SEEKING 25 MLN STG REVOLVING CREDIT

Barbados is making its annual trip to the international capital markets a bit earlier this year and has mandated Barclays Bank Plc to arrange a 25 mln stg revolving credit, Barclays said. The financing will be for seven years, with four years grace, and will allow the borrower to make drawings in U.S. Dollars. The credit will be transferable and carry interest at 1-1/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate. There is a commitment fee of 1/2 pct. Banks are being invited to join at four mln stg for 50 basis points and at 2.5 mln stg for 40 basis points. The terms represent an improvement over those obtained last year, when Barbados tapped the market for a 25 mln dlr transferable loan facility, which carried the same maturity but had interest at 1-1/4 pct over Libor. The facility was subsequently increased to 40 mln dlrs. However, the loan was not signed until November 5, and bankers said that this year Barbados wanted to have the financing in place early to give it greater flexibility in drawing the funds over the course of the year. Last year Barbados boosted its capital market borrowings with a small private yen placement in the Japanese market. At the signing of the 40 mln dlr facility, Winston Cox, advisor to the Central Bank of Barbados, said he was looking to make greater use of the international capital markets to reduce the country's dependence on multi-national orgainsations. However, bankers believe this will be the country's only major financing for this year, although another small private placement in Japan could be arranged later in the year. REUTER 

BOMB EXPLODES AT BRITISH ARMY BASE, 30 INJURED

A huge car bomb exploded at the headquarters of the British Army of the Rhine last night, injuring about 30 people just hours after British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher left the West German capital. A British Army spokeswoman said today that seven people were still being treated for minor injuries in hospitals in the Moenchengladbach area, near the Rheindahlen base, after being being hit by flying shards of glass from the blast. The 100-kg bomb went off outside an officers' mess at 10.30 P.M. (2130 GMT), ripping a crater half a meter (1.5 feet) deep and three meters (nine feet) wide in the ground, and could be heard several kilometers (miles) away, a police spokesman said. An anonymous caller, speaking English, telephoned the West German domestic news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur just before the explosion and said a bomb was about to go off at the base. Thatcher left Bonn early yesterday evening after talks with with Chancellor Helmut Kohl ahead of her visit to Moscow next week. She had flown to West Germany from talks with French President Francois Mitterrand in Normandy earlier in the day. Officers of the Nato Northern Army Group, which is also based at Rheindahlen, were holding a social dinner attended by British and West German servicemen and their wives inside the mess when the bomb went off.

SOVIET SUGAR IMPORTS HIGHER IN OCT/NOV

Soviet sugar imports in October and November were significantly higher than in the same period of the year before, according to figures received by the International Sugar Organization. Imports in October totalled 23,803 tonnes, compared with 4,685 tonnes in the same month of 1985, while November imports were up to 136,029 tonnes from 46,541. For the first 11 months of 1986, Soviet imports totalled 5.12 mln tonnes, against 4.30 mln in the same period of 1985. The October 1986 import figure consisted entirely of whites from Cuba, while the November total was made up of 84,037 tonnes Cuban whites and 51,992 tonnes whites from Thailand. Of the imports in the January/November period, those from Cuba were up to 3.81 mln tonnes from 3.65 mln and from Thailand to 292,808 tonnes from 22,800. Soviet exports also increased in 1986. The January/November export total of 289,232 compares with 165,859 tonnes in the first 11 months of 1985. Exports in October 1986 were 20,064, down from 38,853 a year earlier, while November exports were up from 32,796 to 50,855 tonnes. REUTER 

SOUTH AFRICA/BANKS AGREE NEW TERMS TO REPAY DEBT

Representatives of South Africa's Standstill Coordinating Committee (SCC) and its commercial bank creditors have agreed new terms covering repayments of 14 billion dlrs of debt, banking sources said. The debt is covered by a standstill agreement that expires June 30. Under the new accord, the standstill will be extended for three years to June 30, 1990. There will be an immediate repayment of three pct to all the banks, to be followed by various payments at six-month intervals over the life of the agreement totalling some 1.5 billion dlrs. The three pct payment will be due July 15, 1987. Subsequent repayments will be determined under a complex structure which will be based on the maturity structure of individual banks' loans, the bankers said. The bankers, who declined to be identified, said the agreement also will give banks the option to convert their existing debt into term loans for 10-years, with five years grace. An agreement reached last year allowed for the conversion of the short-term debt covered by the standstill into three-year loans. Bankers said today's talks concluded months of intense negotiations. They said the South African Finance Ministry is expected to make a statement on the agreement later today. A review of South Africa's economy by the economic subcommittee of commercial banks is nearing completion and should be announced shortly, the bankers said. No further details were immediately available. REUTER 

NIGERIA, BRITAIN TO RESCHEDULE OFFICIAL DEBT

Nigeria and Britain signed an agreement to reschedule Nigeria's official debts in the first of an expected series of such talks, government sources said. The agreement was signed by Nigerian Finance Minister Chu Okongwu and the Export Credits Guarantee Department's (ECGD) chief executive Jack Gill. The Nigerians will go on to Paris for similar bilateral talks tomorrow with Coface, the French export credit agency. Today's agreement follows an agreement between Nigeria and the Paris Club of western creditor governments in December to reschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of official debt. The Paris Club agreement was for a rescheduling of the 7.5 billion dlrs of medium and long-term debt due between September 1986 and end 1987 over 10 years with five years grace. But as with all Paris Club pacts, specific interest rates and other details have to be negotiated on a bi-lateral basis with the countries involved. None of the details contained in today's negotiations was immediately available. The Nigerians are hoping that further bilateral accords can be struck fairly soon as this could encourage official export credit agencies to renew insurance cover for exports to Nigeria. The ECGD suspended its cover for exports to Nigeria in 1983. Despite the success of the talks over the past two days, govenment sources said there had not been any discussions on new credits. Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export credits this year from official agencies under a structrual adjustment program drawn up by Nigeria and the World Bank to support a rescheduling of part of the country's 19 billion dlr foreign debt. But these credits cannot be approved until the export credit agencies agree to resume insuring the debts. REUTER 
STERLING OUTLOOK CLOUDED BY TEST OF PARIS ACCORD

The move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into question the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said. Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen sharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index. While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and dollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high U.K. Interest rates. But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday. The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively, the Paris accord could collapse. "On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6 collapses," Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said. He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies. However, although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp drop in the U.K. Currency. Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K. Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates, they said. Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been running especially high after last week's budget, seen as popular both with the markets and with British voters. Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the West German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K. Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound. In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two half-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than two weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the next week or so, has already been largely discounted. U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still relatively high compared to other western countries, and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely to affect sterling. Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline, dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis. Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond (gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point. Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling. Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Current account figures for February. Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after January's small surplus. REUTER 
EC MEMBER STATES COOL ON CEREAL PLANS

European Community (EC) member states have generally given a cool initial reaction to proposals by the European Commission for cereal price changes and related measures in the coming season, EC diplomats said. They said that in meetings of the EC Special Committee on Agriculture representatives of most member states had said the changes, taken together, would have too harsh an impact on farmers' incomes. Only Britain and the Netherlands had shown willingness to accept the commission's overall package, they said. As well as cuts of over two pct in common prices for most cereals, the commission proposes a limitation of intervention to the February to March period and reduced monthly increments in intervention prices. EC Farm Ministers will have a first discussion of the proposals at a meeting beginning next Monday. Reuter 
TIN PACT EXTENSION LIKELY - ITC DELEGATES

An extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement, ITA, for one or two years beyond June 30 is increasingly likely, International Tin Council, ITC, delegates said following a special council session today. A formal decision will be taken at the quarterly council session on April 8-9 when decisions are needed on the budget and activities for the year beginning July one, they stated. Delegates said most countries now favour a continued legal ITC presence to answer the still unresolved legal disputes over the outstanding debts of its buffer stock with court hearings likely to continue well after the June 30 expiry of the pact. The ITC was informally told of the appeal made yesterday by Amalgamated Metal Trading Ltd, AMT, against the January court ruling against it in the legal bid it led on behalf of ITC creditor brokers to have the ITC wound up. In January the judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the tin council, the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the U.K. Companies act, and the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect in respect of an arbitration award. AMT is appealing on all points and has said it is important for the court to accept that a winding-up petition is a move to enforce an arbitration ruling. Reuter 
COCOA BUFFER STOCK ACCORD CLOSER, DELEGATES SAY

The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday. "Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday," a consumer delegate said. "The atmosphere is excellent." Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1, if the rules are agreed by Friday. A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a "very interesting stage of negotiations," delegates said. The package, based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates. Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow. Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired, delegates said. The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins, they said. The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager, the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council. Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they said. The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby, intermediate and forward positions, they added. One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is "transparency," meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager's market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible, delegates said. After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism, they said. Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn, delegates said. The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The existing buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable until rules are agreed. Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules, producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices, delegates said.

NEW S.AFRICA ACCORD WITH BANKS BROUGHT COMPROMISE

A new agreement covering the repayment of part of South Africa's foreign debt represents a compromise between that country and its commercial bank creditors following several weeks of intense and difficult negotiations, senior banking sources said. In Pretoria, Reserve Bank Governor Gerhard De Kock termed the agreement a "good deal" for both South Africa and the banks. But as one senior banker noted, "It is probably the best we could hope for. We (the banks) wanted more money and they (the South Africans) didn't want to pay." The new agreement will extend for three years the standstill arrangement that has been in place since August 1985 and which was due to expire on June 30. Depending on the maturity of the various debts, banks will receive on July 15 repayments representing three pct of the arrears and the overdue debt covered by the standstill. It also will require the repayment over the life of the standstill of another 10 pct of the overdue debt spread over six month invervals and depending on the maturity of the various debts for a total of slightly more than 1.4 billion dlrs. Last year South Africa repaid about 500 mln dlrs out of the 14 billion dlrs covered by the standstill. At the time, bankers had argued - unsuccessfully - for a larger repayment given the country's trade surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs. Bankers had hoped that this time they could secure an even larger repayment of around one billion dlrs. Although there had been speculation that the standstill would be extended for three years, many did not believe that a long term pact would be acceptable to U.S. banks. Those banks have taken a hard line in the negotiations because of America's strong anti-apartheid policies. The agreement reached today differs very little from the one reached a little over a year ago. However, it does include one moderation of an option contained in that pact which introduces yet another "catchphrase" into the jargon for reschedulings. The new agreement contains an "exit vehicle" under which banks can convert their debt into 10 year loans. Under the previous agreement banks were only given options for three year loans. While the option may be unpalatable to the U.S. banks, it could offer others a potential repayment of slightly more than half their investment over the next seven years. To convert the debts, a bank would have to find a borrower looking for a loan with a 10-year maturity and then negotiate individually the interest rates to be charged. The loans would not represent any new money and as the loan would be the obligation of the new borrower there would be a repayment stream that could give the bank as much as 52 pct of face value by year seven, one banker said. Bankers suggested that depending on a banks' political and economic forecasts for South Africa, if it decided to take the option it may not have much difficulty finding such borrowers. They noted that South Africa's Public Investment Commission is an active borrower in this area of the market. Today's agreement was reached between South Africa's chief debt negotiator Chris Stals, who chairs its Standstill Coordinating Commmittee and representatives of the 12 banks on the commercial bank technical committee. The bankers said that telexes will be sent today to the country's other 330 bank creditors and that documentation covering the proposal will be mailed out shortly. Because of the banks' sensitivity to South Africa's apartheid regime, the previous negotiations were conducted with Fritz Leutwiler, the former head of the Swiss National Bank, acting as mediator. Leutwiler was not involved with these talks and has not involved himself in the negotiations since last year, the bankers said. Last time, the banks sent their responses on the proposal to Leutwiler who in turn notified the South Africans. This time the procedure will be less structured and will be up to the individual banks as to how they wish to handle it. Although talks had been held in recent weeks between the South Africans and the banks, the completion of the agreement on the repayments took many in the financial community by surprise. A review of South Africa's economy by the technical committee's economic sub-committee was to be held in February while the talks for the rescheduling were due to start some time this month or next month. However, the bankers said that because of all the publicity which surrounds South African debt negotiations, the meetings were kept secret. Reuter 
MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES

Middle East currency dealers meet in Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from the Arab world to London. The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf currency system is more real that at any time this decade. Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these issues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to be major talking points. About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks -- including some in London and other major non-Arab financial centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins on on Saturday. Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market, by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in London. The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks, foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based banks are boosting their treasury operations in London. As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain ran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K. Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island. The two major Bahrain-based international banks, <Arab Banking Corp> and <Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing. One economist said: "It is cheaper to run a riyal book in London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain... There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London." Jeddah-based <Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia, <National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November 1986. The major market maker has traditionally been London-based consortium bank <Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom joint-venture <Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February. One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: "Inevitably the volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia." Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify. Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986 from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion. The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect <Arab National Bank> to step up London operations. Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region, partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation. There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain and London is still limited. But for the first time since the formation of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon. Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary System style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year. One dealer said: "A lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead." One open question is that of a common peg for currencies. The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the U.S. Dollar. Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies, but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.

UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDS EC SUGAR TENDER RESULT-TRADE

Considerable uncertainty surrounds the outcome of today's EC white sugar tender, traders here said, noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats to move over 800,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention. They said that due to the dispute between the Commission and producers over the issue, it is not clear whether the Commission will authorise any exports at all or grant licences on a large tonnage. The subsidy is seen being set above 45.00 Ecus per 100 kilos, although traders are reluctant to predict a precise level after prices fell yesterday. Earlier, traders in Paris said they expected the Commission to award licences for around 50,000 tonnes of white sugar with a maximum export rebate of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus. Last week, the Commission granted licences to end August on 60,500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44.819. REUTER 

THATCHER DEFENDS UK OIL POLICY IN SAUDI INTERVIEW

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denied in an interview published in Saudi Arabia today that her government's oil policy contributed to weakness in world oil prices. She said the government was determined not to intervene to influence production decisions by oil companies operating in the North Sea. "We believe these must be a matter for the commercial judgment of the oil companies," she told the Arabic language daily al-Sharq al-Awsat in an interview coinciding with a visit to London by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. Thatcher said this policy had not contributed to the fall in oil prices as North Sea production was now about the same as in 1984 when prices were close to 30 dlrs a barrel. British production was on a plateau and was unlikely to increase in the future, she said. "We naturally share the concern of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members about the harmful effects of oil market volatility for both producer and consumer countries," Thatcher said. "On our part, we are careful to avoid any actions which might add to such volatility." REUTER 

London traders were also reluctant earlier to predict the likely tonnage to be authorised for export in view of the on-going dispute between the Commission and European producers over the threatened action by the producers to move over 800,000 tonnes to intervention.

THAI SUGAR PRODUCTION CONTINUES HIGH IN FEB

Thai sugar production continued at a high level in February, latest figures received by the International Sugar Organization (ISO) show. The figures show stocks at end-February of 2.49 mln tonnes raw value against 2.33 mln a year earlier. Analysts said this was a new peak for the date. Production in February was 961,000 tonnes against 888,000 in February 1986 and took the Nov/Feb total for the current crop to 2.25 mln tonnes. Production normally tails off sharply after March, but in recent years production from March to the end of the crop has been over 500,000 tonnes, analysts said. Thailand's exports in February were 32,800 tonnes and consumption 57,800. Last month the Thai Agriculture Ministry said 1986/87 production was expected to fall to 2.3 mln tonnes from 2.48 mln in 1985/86. Reuter 
COCOA TALKS SLOW AT CRUCIAL STAGE - DELEGATES

International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) talks on buffer stock rules have slowed during a crucial phase of negotiations, delegates said, but they remained confident about prospects for reaching agreement by Friday. Cocoa producers, European Community (EC) consumers and all consumers separately reviewed technical details of a buffer stock rules package distributed yesterday. The buffer stock working group of consumers and producers was set to meet later today to debate the proposal jointly for the first time, they said. Delegates said major sticking points were likely to be the amount of non-member cocoa allowed to be bought for the buffer stock, and the fixed price differentials at which different origin cocoas will be offered to the buffer stock manager. Producers would prefer that non-member cocoa not be included in the buffer stock because, if it is, countries such as Malaysia benefit from the cocoa agreement without joining it, the delegates said.

COCOA COUNCIL CHAIRMAN SEEKS BUFFER COMPROMISE

International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, Council chairman, Denis Bra Kanon, said he will attempt to reach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the International Cocoa Agreement. Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations among producers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstanding differences on how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin cocoa, consumer delegates told reporters. Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems. Producers and consumers indicated support "in principle" for the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past week by a small working group, consumer delegates said. Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the council session ends, but certain technical points need further clarification, the delegates said. Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market realities, consumer delegates said. Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote purchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which are normally required by manufacturers, they said. Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which would depress prices, they added. Reuter 

U.K. VISIBLE TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS IN FEBRUARY

Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department said. The current account balance of payments in February showed a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January. Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln surplus, the same as in January. Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January. Trade Department officials said the improvement in Britain's current account contrasted with most private forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been expected. The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January reduced exports that month and that there had been an element of catching up in the February figures. The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from 114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5. The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751 mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425 mln from 352 mln. The Department said the upward trend in non-oil export volume continues and the underlying level of non-oil import volume seems to have stablised.

U.K. TRADE FIGURES BUOY HOPES OF INTEREST RATE CUT

The release of U.K. February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said. Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply narrower than January's 527 mln deficit. "The figures are unreservedly good," Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said. Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level. The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling, which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards. But sentiment now looks to have turned about again. There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, Wroblewski said. Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion. However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expenditure on imported goods. However, Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg. He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry. The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufacturers, Harwood said. U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated. Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960. However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news. Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government's support was slipping.

Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government's support was slipping. The Marplan poll, published in "Today," showed Conservative support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31 pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party, whose own support fell from 38 pct. The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent, political observers said. Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn that today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again. This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data, Harwood said. "The news did come as a very, very substantial relief," he said. However, on the interest rate front, economists caution that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed. REUTER 

ALUMINIUM SCRAP RECOVERY AND USAGE TO RISE

Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market which details cost and demand factors. Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in recent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material increasingly attractive. It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around 550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said. On the demand side, developments in automobiles and packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption. Automobile production, although expected to fall this year, is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry, particularly in the U.S. In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries. In addition to the cost savings involved, technology advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by the secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said. There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the U.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of several European countries, albeit on a smaller scale. Reuter 

COCOA COUNCIL HEAD TO PRESENT BUFFER COMPROMISE

International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates said. Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties. Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow. Some consuming member nations, including Britain and Belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non-member cocoa, delegates have said. The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower quality non-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market. Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said. As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said. Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said. Other technical points need to be sorted out, including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.

PARIS G-6 MEET SET NO TARGETS - LEIGH-PEMBERTON

Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading industrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets. Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee that "we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding" on how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their current levels. He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint currency float - but one which let it still purse an independent monetary policy. "I would concede that, since the Louvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something," Leigh-Pemberton said. "The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together" towards stabilising exchange rates," Leigh-Pemberton said. He did not mention this week's intervention by central banks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test the accord. Leigh-Pemberton said that "the effectiveness of this (cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in the pre-Plaza days" before September 1985. He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing." He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing." Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank of England favoured full EMS membership for sterling, provided such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates lower, he said "the two half point cuts (this month in banks' base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now." Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a "cautious step-by-step approach" to reducing short term interest rates, not least because "we have a potential problem with inflation." Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, "one of the highest" among industrialised nations, he added. Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget on March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10 pct. Regarding sterling's relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall. He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterling index, when compared with the index's level before oil prices dropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975, closed here today at 72.1, unchanged from the previous close. Reuter 
COCOA CHAIRMAN WORKS TOWARDS BUFFER COMPROMISE

International Cocoa Organization's, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon continued work towards a compromise plan on how the ICCO buffer stock should buy cocoa, consumer delegates said. Consumer delegates said Bra Kanon had not formally presented the compromise plan to producers and consumers, and it was unlikely he would do so before Friday, they said. There was widespread confidence a result on the outstanding items could be reached by Friday, when the council session is due to end, consumers said. Bra Kanon completed bilateral consultations with several delegations today on the main sticking points in the draft buffer stock rules package, they said. Certain delegations wanted further discussion on the amount of non-member cocoa the buffer stock will be permitted to buy, differentials for different origin cocoas and limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby, and forward material, the delegates said. The buffer stock working group finalized the remaining buffer stock rules, with only minor modifications to the original draft buffer stock package produced last week, the delegates said. The ICCO council is due to elect a new executive director when it reconvenes Friday, producer delegates said. Producers intend to present a single candidate for the post, and this is most likely to be Edouard Kouame from Ivory Coast, they said. Earlier, the existing executive director, Kobena Erbynn from Ghana, was expected to re-nominated, but he is now likely to withdraw, the delegates said. The executive committee is due to meet Friday at 1100 GMT, with the council unlikely to reconvene until late Friday, consumers said. Reuter 

Mexico denied reports that British banks are resisting signing a 76 billion dlr new loan and rescheduling package. In a statement, the Finance Ministry said the process for formalizing the package was going as planned. Banking sources in London had been quoted earlier as saying the British banks were balking at signing the package in an effort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new 7.7 billion dlr loan contained in the deal. However, the Finance Ministry statement said all the British banks had promised their participation in the loan. "The contribution of each one of them corresponds exactly to the request of the Mexican government," the statememt said. The ministry said Citibank, which chairs Mexico's bank advisory committee, has received cables from the British banks "confirming said commitment."

U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 700 MLN STG

The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 700 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands will drain some 501 mln stg while a rise in note circulation and bankers' balances below target will take out around 285 mln stg and 45 mln stg respectively.

MEXICO DENIES BRITISH BANKS BALKING AT DEBT DEAL

Mexico denied reports that British banks are resisting signing a 76 billion dlr new loan and rescheduling package. In a statement, the Finance Ministry said the process for formalizing the package was going as planned. Banking sources in London had been quoted earlier as saying the British banks were balking at signing the package in an effort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new 7.7 billion dlr loan contained in the deal. However, the Finance Ministry statement said all the British banks had promised their participation in the loan. "The contribution of each one of them corresponds exactly to the request of the Mexican government," the statememt said. The ministry said Citibank, which chairs Mexico's bank advisory committee, has received cables from the British banks "confirming said commitment." The ministry said the books on the package would be closed by mid-April and the first 3.5 billion dlrs of the new money should arrive by the end of the month.

BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES TO STEM DOLLAR FALL

The Bank of Japan intervened in the market to keep the dollar above 149 yen but the unit was under strong selling pressure by an investment trust, dealers said. The central bank stepped into the market when the dollar fell towards 149.00 yen, but a trust bank aggressively sold dollars to hedge currency risks, and the Bank intervened again at 149.00, they said. The trust bank apparently changed its earlier view that the dollar would rise and started selling relatively large amounts of dollars, pushing the unit down to 148.80 at one point, brokers said. One dealer estimated that the Bank bought 400 mln to 500 mln dlrs as it tried to keep the U.S. Currency above 149 yen. REUTER 
SUGAR MARKET SEES GOOD RECENT OFFTAKE

Reports the Soviet Union has lately extended its recent buying programme by taking five to eight raws cargoes from the free market at around 30/40 points under New York May futures highlight recent worldwide demand for sugar for a variety of destinations, traders said. The Soviet buying follows recent whites buying by India, Turkey and Libya, as well as possible raws offtake by China. Some 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes could have changed hands in current activity, which is encouraging for a sugar trade which previously saw little worthwhile end-buyer enquiry, they added. Dealers said a large proportion of the sales to the Soviet Union in the past few days involved Japanese operators selling Thai origin sugar. Prices for nearby shipment Thai sugars have tightened considerably recently due to good Far Eastern demand, possibly for sales to the Soviet Union or to pre-empt any large block enquiries by China, they said. Thai prices for March/May 15 shipments have hardened to around 13/14 points under May New York from larger discounts previously, they added. Traders said the Soviet Union might be looking to buy more sugar in the near term, possibly towards an overall requirement this year of around two mln tonnes. It is probable that some 1.8 mln tonnes have already been taken up, they said. Turkey was reported this week to have bought around 100,000 tonnes of whites while India had further whites purchases of two to three cargoes for Mar/Apr at near 227 dlrs a tonne cost and freight and could be seeking more. Libya was also a buyer this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around 229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added. Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders said. Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later. Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white sugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender for 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for arrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August.

COCOA BUFFER STOCK COMPROMISE GAINING ACCEPTANCE

A final compromise proposal on cocoa buffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members, delegates said. "We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we still have some work to do," producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of Ghana told Reuters after a producers' meeting. European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted "no problems" in getting full consumer acceptance. Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement today, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they said. The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations. The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier proposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted. Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into the buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to him. The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move some delegates described as "just fiddling." But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease some countries that were not satisfied with the original proposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said. The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or forward positions, delegates said. If the compromise is accepted by the council, most consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect next week, or as soon as practically possible. The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to discuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all parties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meet before the council.

ICCO COUNCIL AGREES COCOA BUFFER STOCK RULES

The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) Council reached agreement on rules to govern its buffer stock, the device it uses to keep cocoa off the market to stabilise prices, ICCO delegates said. The date on which the new rules will take effect has not been decided but delegates said they expected them to come into force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can begin buying or selling cocoa. Since prices are below the "may-buy" level of 1,655 Special Drawing Rights a tonne set in the cocoa pact, the manager is likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said. Delegates and traders said they expected the manager, Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks of the pact coming into force. The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a posted price as in the previous cocoa accord. The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa. Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and forward positions. The council meeting, which is expected to conclude two weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the council itself, was continuing, the delegates said. The current cocoa agreement came into force on January 20 during a previous meeting of the council which was unable to agree on the rules to implement buffer stock operations. REUTER 

COCOA BUFFER DIFFERENTIALS DETAILED

The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) council agreed standard price differentials for different origin cocoas to form part of the buffer stock buying and selling procedure, consumer delegates said. The buffer stock manager will accept offers for different origin cocoas according to a sliding scale of price differentials, under which Ghana cocoa will be pegged at a 137 stg premium to Malaysian. Thus, if the buffer stock manager was buying cocoa based on a Malaysian price of 1,200 stg a tonne, he would accept Ghana offers up to 1,337 stg. Differentials were fixed as follows, Country Differential stg/tonne Malaysia 0 Brazil 55 Ivory Coast 67 Cameroun 77 Nigeria 120 Togo 130 Ghana 137 Nigeria's differential is on "landed weight" terms.

NEW LME ALUMINIUM CONTRACT WELCOMED BY TRADE

The London Metal Exchange's, LME, decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract, with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a positive move, physical traders and LME dealers said. Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1, 1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct contract. This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-European delivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts. Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform with existing industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt material, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded. The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said. Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler with a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be done during the sterling rings, they added. LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the recent wide backwardations. Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc countries, such as Romania. The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined as an exporter recently, they said. Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where there are many holders of large short positions on the LME. But others said the new contract would soon attract trading interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been attracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations. The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they said. Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract, gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process in this case may take longer, they added. Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations, which make physical trading difficult, would not totally disappear as a result, the trade sources said. These premiums for prompt metal have become a semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased business and volatility in traded options, and are presently around 50 stg. Increasingly large granting of option positions has been taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes around these dates are commonplace, they said. Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of having to cover. But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even though the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the declaration and prompt dates. These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the month, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th. Backwardations will remain while operators continue to grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said. Reuter 

CHINA HELPS IRAN TO DEVELOP NEW MISSILES - PAPER

Iran has produced a short-range surface-to-surface missile with technological help from China and is working with Peking on a longer-range missile capable of hitting most areas of Iraq, the Observer newspaper said. The British Sunday paper, quoting Iranian sources, said the shorter-range missile was based on a Chinese version of the Soviet-made Frog and had been fired at the Iraqi port of Basra. The missile has a range of 40 miles. The other type, similar to the Soviet army"s Scud B with a range of 180 miles, is at an advanced stage of development, according to the Observer. The development of a longer-range weapon would enable Iran to strike at many towns and cities on the territory of its relatively small neighbour. Earlier this month, Iran acknowledged it had acquired Chinese-made Silkworm missiles capable of hitting tankers carrying crude oil from Arab countries to the West. Iran said it would use its Silkworm anti-ship missile against shipping in the waterway only if Iraqi air and missile raids prevented it from exporting oil. The Silkworms are large mobile missiles with a range of 60 miles, which can carry a warhead of 1,000 pounds. REUTER 
COFFEE PRICES BAD NEWS FOR LATIN AMERICA -MINISTER

A senior Nicaraguan official said a recent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically disastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries. Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO) executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to discuss the fall in coffee prices. London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to 1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February. Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on Latin America, both economically and politically. He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September. Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil. Central American economic ministers have estimated the region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in 1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement, Martinez said. He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because consumer members lack the political will to fully support commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to producers. REUTER 

COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE, BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE

The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said. The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks. European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long. "If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further, and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices," a European dealer said. And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying, or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically, dealers said. The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO, into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range. A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time. The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the "must-buy" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement, the sources said. The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said. The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock. ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. "We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market," Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee. However, some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact. Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings, made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock. According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany, "Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There were no real winners or losers." Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have, delegates said. Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock. London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg in January 1986. A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it, according to the agreement. The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says. The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said. REUTER 

NIGERIA TO ISSUE 1.5 BILLION DLRS OF NOTES

Nigeria plans to issue on April 7 a further 1.5 billion dlrs in short-term promissory notes to its uninsured trade creditors in connection with existing arrears on those debts, Law Debenture Trust Corp Plc said as trustee for the notes. It said Nigeria also plans to hold talks with a newly appointed representative for those creditors fairly soon, and that Nigeria also will call "at an early date" an extraordinary meeting of noteholders, including holders of the new notes. The purpose of that meeting will be to consider a resolution to the arrears on the trade debt and the promissory notes. Nigeria missed the first principal payment due on the notes last autumn and another payment of about 30 mln dlrs that was due in early January because of a cash shortage, which stemmed partly from the drop in oil prices last year. An official of the Law Debenture Trust said he did not know when the new representative for the noteholders, David Murison, would meet the Nigerians. He noted the Nigerians currently are attempting to negotiate bilateral agreements with members of the Paris Club of western creditor governments under a multilateral pact on these debts reached in December. So far, bilateral accords have been reached with the U.K. And France. Law Debenture Trust, as trustee for the notes, has been attempting to organise a meeting between the note holders and Nigeria for the last coupole of months. The appointment of Murison, chairman of Westpac Banking Corp's Mase Westpac Ltd unit in London, was made in an effort to better coordinate these efforts. The Law Debenture official said Murison will begin talks with Nigeria as soon as they return to London. And although it is hoped that a meeting of all note holders could be held by end-May, he said this may not be possible since four weeks notice of the meeting is required by law. The discussions with the note holders are being held in conjunction with proposals to rescheduling Nigeria's debt to commercial banks and official credit agencies. When talks began last April on rescheduling part of the country's approximate 19 billion dlrs of foreign debt, the commercial banks insisted that it be contingent on Nigeria obtaining a rescheduling of its official debts as well. The Nigerians then extended this to include all uninsured trade debt. The commercial bank package has yet to be signed due in part to the reluctance of Japanese banks, which have a relatively small exposure, to participate. REUTER 

PARIS MEET AGREED NOT TO PUBLISH BANDS - LAWSON

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies. Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson replied, "we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to." When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said "I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not to make it easy for" speculation against the accord. Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors. But if such movements were due to extraneous factors, Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges. "It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented," Lawson said. In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's current level, adding that "It is an objective ... To try to keep it around that level." He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the pound had weathered that period so successfully. "There has been a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals," Lawson said. He disagreed with what he termed "the grossly exaggerated claim" that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of other major industrialsed countries. Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average. Lawson confirmed that "over the medium and longer term, the government's objective is zero inflation." He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP "is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine." He added that "to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation." Reuter 

THATCHER SAYS TRADE TARGETS SET WITH MOSCOW

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she and Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov had set targets for increased trade between the two countries during talks earlier today. She said she hoped more economic exchanges between Britain and the Soviet Union "will also lead to increased friendship and increased understanding." Earlier, she told a meeting of Soviet and British businessmen that she had agreed with Ryzhkov that they would work to achieve a total volume of 2.5 billion roubles in bilateral trade by 1990. This would entail an increase by each side of 350 to 400 mln stg over their present export levels. "Mr Ryzhkov handed me a list of import and export opportunities which I hope you will all jump at," she told the meeting to mark the opening of new offices of the British- Soviet Chamber of Commerce. After her talks with Ryzhkov, Thatcher and the Soviet Premier were joined for the signing of agreements covering new scientific and cultural exchanges by Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who had nine hours of talks with her yesterday.

BRAZIL TO BE WORLD'S THIRD LARGEST VEHICLES MARKET

Brazil will be producing 2.8 mln vehicles a year by the end of this century and it could become the world's third largest national market for motor vehicles, according to a report by the Economist magazine's Economist Intelligence Unit. The report stated that Brazil already offered a huge national market for the vehicle producers and offered potential access to other large Latin American markets. "Development of a fully integrated motor industry in Brazil may not be far away," it said. Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford and Fiat are all operating modern car plants in Brazil now, it added. "Multinationals will want to consolidate and then expand in Brazil because of the enormous sourcing opportunities that such a relatively low cost producer offers," the report said. It pointed out, however, that corporate life in Brazil was complicated by its economic situation. "At present Brazil is suffering from a debt crisis, rampant inflation and exchange rate fluctuations," the Intelligence Unit said. "In spite of this, Brazil's resilience is maintained by the potential created by its still under-exploited natural and human resources. The reward for holding out in the present economic climate could be huge," it added. REUTER 

ICO BOARD PASSES OVER COFFEE QUOTA ISSUE

Executive board members of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, passed over the issue of export quota negotiations at its regular meeting here, delegates said. No move was made to reopen dialogue on export quotas and no further discussion on the issue is likely during the three-day talks, they said. Producer and consumer members of the ICO council failed to agree export quota shares in early March. Neither Brazil, the largest producer, nor the U.S., the largest consumer, are ready to be flexible, delegates said. "The situation is unchanged," consumer spokesman Abraham Van Overbeeke told reporters. "As long as Brazil sticks to its position there will not be quotas -- there is no point in meeting." At the last council meeting, Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of around 30 pct of the market. Consumers and a splinter group of eight producers favoured redistribution of export shares using "objective criteria," which would likely have reduced Brazil's share. Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said that, if quota negotiations were to resume, the 1.0 mln bag shortfall Brazil was willing to give up in early March if the producer proposal was accepted would no longer be on the table. "As we said from the start...No agreement, no one million bags," he told Reuters. Shortfalls of 200,000 bags offered by OAMCAF, the African and Malagasy Coffee Organization, and 20,000 bags offered by Angola, are also no longer valid, delegates said. The closest the board came to discussing quotas was a briefing by the Guatemalan ICO delegate Rene Montes on a recent Latin American producers meeting in Managua, delegates said. There, the producers expressed their political will to negotiate basic quotas, particularly in the face of the damaging drop in coffee prices after the council failed to agree quotas, Montes said. The ICO board also reviewed export statistics and stock verification. They expected talks on stock verification to take up the remainder of today's session, delegates said. Reuter 
ALUMINIUM CAPACITY GROWTH TREND SEEN INSUFFICIENT

Aluminium capacity expansion planned for the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any acceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on the scale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony Bird Associates' 1987 Aluminium Review. By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to be around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mln tonnes are scheduled, Bird said. Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and increased imports by less developed countries. Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate by as much as general growth, but non-socialist world consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from 13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Bird said. Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of change after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have served them well in recent years. In order to encourage the construction of additional smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher level. Production costs are likely to rise again in the years ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies, according to the review. At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and 89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said. Such a price development is not expected to cause any marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the pipeline for steel and copper. In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said, as the world economy has not responded well to the opportunities offered by cheap oil. Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4 pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higher in 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes. Reuter 

Although the physical industry is aware of the market and follows its prices keenly, this has not been reflected in market volume, Elmer said.

International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers will meet at 1500 GMT (0900 est) for a general discussion of the market situation, producer spokesman Lindenberg Sette said. The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the meeting but Brazil was not among them. The ICO executive board's regular session this week has so far been confined to routine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to revive export quota negotiations, delegates said. Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how quotas should be allocated.

LONDON STOCK SYSTEM BIG SUCCESS, OFFICIAL SAYS

The restructured London Stock Exchange has proved itself an unqualified success in less than six months of operation, according to exchange chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison. More than 95 pct of the business has left the trading floor and is now conducted in the offices of member firms, Goodison said in remarks prepared for delivery in New York. "Competitive bids and offers can now be seen on screens all over the country and business done is displayed on those same screens," he said, reaching more investors than before. Goodison said the new system has helped investors by promoting greater competition that in turn has led to reduced commissions and spread. He said the exchange is now working on a small order automated execution system and a system to transfer securities without certificates. New laws to be enacted in full later this year will help the Securities and Investments Board investigate suspected abuses and punish wrongdoing, Goodison said. He believes it is a misconception to say that the U.K. system of self-regulation is not as good as the U.S. system. He noted that any violations of the rules are a criminal offense. "There is no fifth amendment plea to offer a U.K. inspector hot on the trial of an insider dealer," Goodison said, in a reference to the U.S. legal system which allows individuals to remain silent on the grounds that they may incriminate themselves. Goodison said a major goal of the London exchange is to persuade multinational corporations to seek a listing in London.

U.K. INTERVENTION BOARD DETAILS EC SUGAR SALES

A total 102,350 tonnes of current series white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 46.864 European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board said. Out of this, traders in France received 31,000 tonnes, in West Germany 21,000, in Belgium 19,050, in the U.K. 15,800, in Denmark 8,500, in the Netherlands 6,000 and in Spain 1,000 tonnes, it added. Earlier today, London traders had expected the subsidy for the current season whites campaign for licences to end-Sep to be around 46.80 Ecus per 100 kilos while French traders had put the rebate at around 46.40 Ecus. Traders here had also forecast today's total authorised sugar tonnage export awards up to 100,000 tonnes versus 59,000 last week when the restitution was 45.678 Ecus. Total export authorisations for the 1985/86 campaign (42 weeks) now stand at 2,076,620 tonnes. REUTER 
JARDINE DECLINES COMMENT ON HONGKONG LAND REPORT

A spokesman for Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd <JARD.HK> said he could neither confirm nor deny a newspaper report which said Jardine was thinking of moving its listed property subsidiary <Hongkong Land Ltd> to Bermuda. "I don't know how the report was originated ... I cannot comment," the spokesman at Jardine's London office said when asked to react to a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper. The report said Jardine, which moved its place of domicile from Hong Kong to Bermuda in the wake of the agreement to transfer the British colony back to China in 1997, was contemplating a similar move for Hongkong Land. The Daily Telegraph quoted Jardine chairman Simon Keswick as saying Hongkong Land was at a crossroads now that all its non-property assets as well as its major residential properties in Hong Kong are being sold off. This left the company to focus its attention on prime site commercial property in Hong Kong's city centre only, it said. "If we can't find any opportunities here we may have to look abroad ... If we look abroad the structure of the company becomes very important," Keswick was quoted as saying. REUTER 

ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY - DELEGATES

The restoration of coffee export quotas before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept 30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates told reporters. Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the quota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, they said. Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30 pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectively torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas before October, the delegates noted. Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today, traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said. Producer delegates said that while the possibility of reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in practice the idea had effectively been discarded. The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are still remote, producer delegates said. Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored, despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last month's negotiations, they said. "With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to negotiate quotas," one leading producer delegate said. Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season (mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's crop. Many producers are more interested in working towards reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of quota allocations valid until the International Coffee Agreement expires in 1989, they said. Guatemala has already proposed the "other oilds" producer group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how to allocate quota shares. Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the principle of "objective criteria" favoured by consumers. At last month's council session a splinter group of small producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments. A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now supported their cause. The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota accord in October also looked bleak. The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of quota shares based on "objective criteria." ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets in September. Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee, they said. They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which would most likely end in failure. Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation but had only a general discussion about how further negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said. Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not fixed, he said. The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled, delegates said. Reuter 

LAWSON WANTS STERLING AROUND 1.60 DLRS, 2.90 MKS

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was, specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs. He told the National Economic Development Council that the recent Paris meeting of major industrialised nations had agreed on the need for exchange rate stability. There was now a "reasonable alignment of currencies" and the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about its present level, he said. That meant around 2.90 marks, which is the single most important rate to concentrate on, and 1.60 dlrs, Lawson said. His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was highly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said. In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the Government's exchange rate policy, lest it give foreign exchange markets set limits to test. Lawson told the committee, which is a tripartite forum of government, unions and industry, that the pound would be kept near its present level by a mixture of interest rates and intervention in the foreign exchange markets. The pound finished trading here today at 1.6040/50 dlrs and 2.9210/45 marks. His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was highly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said.

BRITISH SUGAR SOWINGS OFF TO SLOW START

Drilling of this year's British sugar beet crop got off to a slow start due to poor weather conditions with only around one pct sown so far, a spokesman for British Sugar Plc said. This compares with two pct at the same stage last year, three pct in 1985 and 38 to 39 pct in 1984. There is little cause for concern with better weather forecast and the capacity available to drill the contracted area of around 200,000 hectares in about 10 days. Seed beds look good and farmers are advised to wait for soil temperatures to rise, the spokesman said. "If the crop can be drilled by the third week in April we will be delighted," he said. Last year a large proportion of the crop was not drilled until May but it still turned out to be the equal second largest on record. Reuter 
ICO TALKS SET TO END WITH NO QUOTA DEBATE

The International Coffee Organization executive board meeting will end tomorrow without any move to reopen the debate on restoring coffee export quotas, delegates said. Talks have focused on administrative matters and verification of stocks in producer countries, they said. Producers met briefly today to exchange views on the market situation but there seems little chance discussion on quotas will begin much before the ICO's annual council session in September, they said. Delegates earlier thought the meeting would end tonight, but a further session is scheduled tomorrow at 1030 GMT to complete reports on stock verification. Meantime, the executive board will meet May 12 to discuss possible action on the consultancy report on the ICO presented today to the board, consumer delegates said. Reuter 

U.K. MONEY RATES HARDEN ON LAWSON CURRENCY TARGETS

Money market rates rates showed a harder edge after news U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has set a target for the pound against the mark and dollar, to be maintained by a mixture of interest rates and intervention in the foreign exchange markets. Dealers said the market was surprised by the Chancellor's disclosure of sterling target rates, around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, and nervous over the implications for domestic interest rates, further reducing the propects for a near term cut in U.K. Bank base rates. The key three months interbank sterling rate gained 1/16 point at 10 9-7/8 pct. The pound opened three basis points lower at 71.3 in trade weighted terms, at around 1.59 dlrs and 2.91 marks. REUTER 
U.K. MONEY MARKET DEFICIT FORECAST AT 800 MLN STG

The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 800 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills for repurchase by the market will drain some 664 mln stg while bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will take out around 508 mln stg and a rise in note circulation some 45 mln stg. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions and bankers' balances above target will add some 380 mln stg and 35 mln stg to the system respectively. REUTER 
U.K. MONEY RATES FIRM ON LAWSON STERLING TARGETS

Interest rates on the London money market were slightly firmer on news U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson had stated target rates for sterling against the dollar and mark, dealers said. They said this had come as a surprise and expected the targets, 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, to be promptly tested in the foreign exchange markets. Sterling opened 0.3 points lower in trade weighted terms at 71.3. Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his goals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency markets and interest rates. Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in U.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term, dealers said. The feeling remains in the market, however, that fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in U.K. Interest rates is not very likely. The market is expected to continue at around these levels, reflecting the current 10 pct base rate level, for some time. The key three months interbank rate was 1/16 point firmer at 10 9-7/8 pct. 

 UK reserves rise underlying 1.785 billion dlrs in March - official



U.K. RESERVES SHOW LARGE UNDERLYING RISE IN MARCH

Britain's gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 1.785 billion dlrs in March after a 287 mln dlr rise in January, the Treasury said. This was considerably above market expectations for a 650 mln dlr rise. The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments. The Treasury declined comment on the figures. Last month it said the Bank of England took the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn. Actual reserves rose by 1.89 billion dlrs, after rising 305 mln in February, to 22.26 billion. Total reserves were revalued to 27.04 billion dlrs, but would have totalled 24.15 billion under the previous valuation, the Treasury said. Gold reserves were revalued by 895 mln dlrs, while SDRs, ECU and convertible currency holdings were revalued by 1.995 billion. Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 361 mln dlrs last month, after 36 mln in February. Repayments were 240 mln dlrs after the previous 16 mln. Capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, after February's two mln dlrs repayment. REUTER 
LAWSON REMARKS DASH HOPES OF EARLY U.K. RATE CUT

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling, dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts said. But the market's reaction, testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed. In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy, Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs. Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels, using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this. The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these. Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson. But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson's statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy. Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said, "the remarks have been blown out of proportion. Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue." Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, "there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor's statement." He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate, perhaps by as much as 10 pct. "It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate," Brett said. Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said. "Making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake," one senior dealer with a U.S. Bank said. Capel's Skeoch said, "it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at." "It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in stone, they can change with time," Skeoch said. Brett said, "we think the 2.90 marks level is a central rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine." Not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar. Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted. "Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or throw in its lot with Europe," Dunn said. "It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark," he said. Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following Lawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term. "Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some extremely good economic indicators," Capel's Skeoch said. Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March, the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards. REUTER 

Eugene Rotberg, World Bank vice president-treasurer, said in a prepared statement that the prepayments are being made because of the substantial decline in interest rates over the past two years, the spokesman said. The World Bank intends to exercise early redemption on selected public issues of its securities in Switzerland and other capital markets if the exercise is financially beneficial and consistent with the Bank's overall funding strategy. Last month, Rotberg said that the World Bank planned to bring forward to the first half of 1987 its borrowing plans for the year because of its expectations that world interest rates will rise by the year end.

He said he had told the NEDC, a tripartite forum of government, unions and industry, that the pound would be kept near its present level by a mixture of interest rates and intervention on foreign exchange markets. He then repeated to the panel that he remained satisfed with sterling at around its current levels following the Paris accord in February on currency stabilisation. Reuter 
EC TO RELEASE MORE UK INTERVENTION FEED WHEAT

The European Community Commission decided today to make available a further 70,000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for sale on to the British domestic market, trade sources said here. This will be additional to the 31,000 tonnes remaining after this week's sale of 126,031 tonnes of domestic feed wheat to the home market, British officials said in London. Reuter 
WORLD BANK REFINANCED 500 BILLION YEN OF LOANS

The World Bank over the last month repaid and refinanced 500 billion yen in loans at more favourable interest rates in what was the first step in a plan to refinance its existing debt, Eugene Rotberg, World Bank vice-president/treasurer said. He told Reuters in a telephone interview from Washington that the moves are consistent with, but not driven by, the Bank's view that interest rates have essentially bottomed out and will move higher by year-end. Rotberg was responding to a question following news the Bank would exercise its option to prepay early some 196 mln Swiss francs of existing bonds in the Swiss franc market. The bond redemptions are the first in the public market and may be followed by similar moves in other capital markets if the Bank considers the exercise financially beneficial and consistent with its overall funding strategy. Rotberg noted that the World Bank is very liquid right now, with some 18 billion dlrs in cash available. The Bank will be looking at various instruments and the levels they are trading at in determining what issues will be repaid, he said. However, Rotberg said that unlike the yen loans, there was no immediate plan to refinance the Swiss franc bonds, although the Bank could possibly issue new debt in that market over the next few months. He said that the yen loans, which were the equivalent of some three billion dlrs principal amount, had been from the Japanese long-term credit banks, trust banks and insurance companies and had interest rates of between seven and nine pct. All the borrowings were refinanced as traditional syndicated loans with the same parities at the Japanese long-term prime rate, currently 5.8 pct. The World Bank borrows in excess of 10 billion dlrs a year, with almost all its borrowings in medium and long-term fixed rate markets. Rotberg declined to say whether the 1/4 point rise in U.S. Prime rates yesterday to 7-3/4 pct signalled a reversal in the trend in interest rates. "Over the short term, rates could go up or they could go down," he said, adding that the bank takes a longer view on interest rates when deciding its financing strategy. However, given the current level of interest rates, it would not be wise to take short-term money on to the liability side of the Bank's balance sheet, he said. REUTER 
BRITISH TELECOM <BTY> GIVES CTG TO MITEL <MLT>

British Telecommunications PLC has transferred the information systems division of its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, CTG Inc, to 51-pct-owned Mitel Corp, Mitel said. It said the transfer was designed to strengthen Mitel's position in the Canadian market. British Telecom acquired 51 pct of Mitel in March, 1986, while CTG became a wholly owned British Telecom subsidiary in May, 1985. Mitel said the transfer of holdings represents a restructuring of British Telecom's private branch exchange (PBX) interests in Canada. It said the CTG unit will become the center of a newly formed Mitel direct sales division, which will sell SX-2000 products to major Canadian business customers. Reuter 
EC FREES MORE U.K. INTERVENTION WHEAT FOR SALE

The EC Cereals Management Committee agreed in Brussels today that 300,000 tonnes of U.K. Intervention wheat would be made available for sale on the U.K. Home market over the next three months, the Ministry of Agriculture said. The committee agreed that 70,000 tonnes of wheat would be made available on April 14 followed by a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month. It also gave an assurance that a further 100,000 tonnes would be allocated for both May and June, which would complete the 300,000 tonnes originally requested by the U.K.. The ministry said sales out of intervention for July and August would be discussed later. Earlier, Paris trade sources said the EC Commission made available a further 70,000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for sale to the domestic market. Reuter 
COFFEE PRICES SET TO CONTINUE SLIDE - TRADERS

Coffee prices look set to continue sliding in the near term, given the lack of progress towards a new International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quota accord, according to coffee traders and analysts. Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lows yesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, when the lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmed expectations that efforts to restore quotas would not be revived at this stage, they said. The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 cents a lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years. Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO's annual September council session, and in the interim the Brazilian frost season from June to August may prove the only bullish factor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futures bounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading range around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the market recovered from yesterday's "confidence blip," one trader commented. But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lower prices in the near future, one trade source said. The market had become increasingly vulnerable to yesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stg second position trading range for 22 successive sessions, he said. Technically the market is more likely to decline further as it absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the 1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a "three figure mentality," and speculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the psychological 1,000 stg level, he added. Some traders said today's upturn was in part due to Brazil's opening last night of May green coffee export registrations. This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as no surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and light trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence. However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test of support at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the only possible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach of Brazil's frost season, they said. Roasters are believed to be well covered, limiting activities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally not taking up producer offers, they added. Central American producers have sold the bulk of their current crops, but robusta producers in West Africa and Indonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment, and this could pressure prices further, traders said. However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to be bullish, advised caution. "Everybody's bearish now, just as they were bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg," he said. Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expressed doubts the price spiral would continue much below current levels. "One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers -- there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall." While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September 1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail prices. "Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like that at this stage," a General Foods spokesman said. Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in response to market weakness. At the beginning of March the price of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65 stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue to fall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added. Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in the near future. "The market seems to have established some equilibrium and doesn't look set to go much lower," a Nestle spokesman commented. Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, which fell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg per kilo for medium quality, traders added. Reuter 
LAWSON SAYS G-7 TO REVIEW PARIS ACCORD NEXT WEEK

The Group of Seven industrialised countries will make use of next week's International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington to evaluate the Paris accord on currency stabilisation, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters. "On Tuesday I shall be going to Washington for meetings of the (IMF) Interim Committee and Development Committee, and we shall of course be having a meeting of the G-7," Lawson said. "And on the G-7, although there is no formal agenda, I would imagine that the first thing we do would be to review how the Paris accord has gone since it was agreed in February." Lawson said G-7 finance ministers will be reviewing medium-term economic objectives and projections involving domestic and external variables. Also examined will be performance indicators for each country. The Paris accord set objectives for such sectors as growth, inflation, current account and trade balances, budget performances, monetary conditions and exchange rates. Lawson said "At both the G-7 and the Interim Committee we will undoubtedly be discussing the debt problem. Clearly the debt problem is still with us, and still with us in quite a big way." Reuter 
STERLING REBOUNDS ON LAWSON "TARGET"-DENIAL

Sterling made a sharp recovery when U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson described remarks he made yesterday on targets for the pound as "insignificant," rallying back up almost exactly to the levels it had fetched before Lawson spoke yesterday, dealers and analysts said. They said sterling would likely leave the limelight once again to trade quietly around current levels, as the markets set their sights on the dollar, yen and mark again ahead of key international monetary talks in Washington next week. Sterling ended its European day at 1.6020/30 dlrs, virtually unchanged from yesterday's last 1.6040/50 dlrs, fetched before Lawson's first comment. But it was well up on levels just above 1.59 dlrs which it had held until the second comment came. Against the mark, sterling recovered to close at 2.9190/9240 marks after today's opening 2.9040/90 and last night's 2.9210/45. "On balance, it is as if nothing happened ... We are back to where we were before," Mark Brett, economist at securities house Barclays de Zoete Wedd said. "This whole story is like a storm in a teacup," a dealer with a U.K. Bank commented. The pound's recovery was triggered when Lawson criticised media coverage of comments he made yesterday, when he told a conference he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was. In this context, Lawson was reported to have specified rates of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs to the pound in remarks which markets were quick to interpret as a signal to sell sterling. Lawson said today he had merely stated yesterday's approximate value of the pound. "The wrong end of the stick was picked up," he told reporters, adding his comments did in no way signal a change in British exchange rate policies. Dealers and analysts said the reactions to both statements were clear evidence that the market, frustrated by the relative currency stability after the February 22 Paris agreement, was desperate to reactivate trading and would react to any clues offered about the contents of the currency accord. In Paris, finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada are widely believed to have agreed exchange rate targets, although no participant has specified these in an apparent bid to foster stability by keeping markets guessing. "The markets are absolutely desperate to get clues on Group of Six (countries that are part to the Paris agreement) targets ... The number of rumours flying around is bigger than ever before," said Barclays de Zoete Wedd's Brett. Analysts said neither yesterday's remarks nor today's had changed their impression that after Paris, sterling was targeted to trade in broad ranges against major currencies. All polled analysts said if anything, the 2.90 marks level mentioned by Lawson was probably the centre of a wide 20-pfennig range which sterling would easily hold, helped by good economic indicators and relatively high interest rates. "It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate," Brett said. He expected sterling to firm over the next few weeks, to around 2.95 marks and 1.63 dlrs, as overseas investors reappraised high-yielding investments here. Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said he was not surprised to see Lawson qualify his sterling target comments so quickly. "His remarks gave markets a target to aim at," he said, adding, "He (Lawson) talked himself into a bit of a corner on this ... It made him a hostage to fortune." Marshall and other analysts dismissed a theory, that by quoting target rates Lawson had attempted to put pressure on prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to agree to British membership of the European Monetary System (EMS), as implausible.

THATCHER PROSPECTS BOOSTED BY USSR TRIP, POLL SAYS

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has improved her standing with voters, according to the first opinion poll published since her return from the Soviet Union. Thatcher is seeking re-election for a third term and the newspaper said there would now be pressure on her to go for a June or even a May election to capitalise on her Soviet trip. The survey, by the Harris Research Centre for today's London Daily News, said more than half of the 767 voters polled by telephone believed she had improved the prospects of arms reductions and peace while 22 pct said they were more likely to vote for her now than before her visit. The poll was bad news for Labour opposition leader Neil Kinnock. It showed that his popularity had slumped following his trip to Washington last week to explain his anti-nuclear policies. Thirty five pct of those polled said their opinion of him had gone down since the trip and only 13 pct were more in favour of him. In contrast, 46 pct said they were more impressed with Thatcher after her trip to the Soviet Union. Only 14 pct rated her less highly. REUTER 

Raw sugar futures had a quiet opening call of 38 lots with prices holding steady from last night with gains of 20 to 80 cents a tonne, dealers said. Aug was trading at 157.60 dlrs from 157.40 asked yesterday. The modest rise continued the recent rally from an oversold situation but, dealers noted, there was little fresh physicals news to stimulate activity. Whites tenders are scheduled for next Wednesday by Syria for 36,000 tonnes and Greece for 40,000 tonnes while Pakistan is due to tender on April 11 for 100,000 tonnes whites, they said.

LONDON COCOA TRADES AT LOWS BY MIDMORNING

Cocoa futures fell to session lows by midmorning, posting losses from last night of six to two stg a tonne in 1987 deliveries, dealers said. Weekend profittaking by jobbers and general book-squaring featured the fall which was aided by steady sterling versus the dollar and lack of offtake in the physicals market. Dealers said the market was switch and straddle-bound, in that any pressure on one particular month was certain to be reflected in adjacent deliveries. The undertone, however, remained cautious as operators await an eventual start to ICCO buffer stock buying, dealers said. The market was originally forecast to open with average five stg gains from last night following New York's firmer close yesterday, dealers said. But this was largely counter-balanced by currency factors. Near July traded at its session low of 1,327 stg after one hour versus 1,333 bid last night and an early high of 1,335. Volume midmorning was 730 lots including 350 lots crossed and 108 switches. There was no sign of any origin activity. REUTER 
LONDON SUGAR TRADES AT SESSION HIGHS BY MIDMORNING

Raw sugar futures firmed to session highs by midmorning, securing gains from last night's basically steady close of 1.00 to 1.80 dlrs a tonne in a 166 lot volume. Shortcovering against an oversold situation continued to play a part in the extended rally with unsettled dollar rates versus sterling providing additional support. Recent and prospective whites buying in the world market was supportive but the raws section lacked feature, dealers said. India and Egypt bought white sugar this week while next week sees tenders by Pakistan, Greece and Syria, they said. May was at 154 dlrs from 152.80 asked last night. All London Daily prices rose two dlrs a tonne on tone. The Raws price was set at 150 dlrs Fob and 173 dlrs (107.50 stg) Cif. The Whites price was at 192 dlrs from 190 yesterday. REUTER 
CLOSURE OF BP SWEDEN REFINERY FORECAST

A Swedish Finance Ministry committee forecast that British Petroleum Plc <BP.L> may have to close its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening of the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness. It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil consumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content and competition from Norway's Mongstad facility of <Den Norske Stats Olieselskab> (Statoil) <STAT.OL> when its expansion is completed in the 1990s. The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a de-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless costly investments were made to enhance the facility's capacity to refine a broader range of products. But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in recent years been above that of the European refining industry on average. The BP plant, in which Sweden's state-owned <OK Petroleum AB> has a 22 pct, started up in 1967 and has an annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes. There was nobody at British Petroleum immediately available for comment. 
RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING

The recent fall in world sugar prices, due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said. Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly market report. "And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for May/June shipment, Man added. The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said. Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5 mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3 mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier. Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down. Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln tonnes. However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability, Man said. Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements. A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market, Man said. The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency. As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said. Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market. Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention, it added. REUTER 

ABNORMAL RADIATION FOUND IN SOVIET TEA/HAZELNUTS

Abnormally high levels of radiation were found in Soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months after the Chernobyl nuclear accident, West German residents in Moscow were advised this week. In a letter to the West German community here, Ambassador Joerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought in Moscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and -137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts. Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University, including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, were found to be free of radiation, it said. Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts contained caesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced no particular health danger as most of the caesium remained in the tea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts. The products sent for testing were bought in state shops and private farmers' markets in Moscow, it added. Other Western embassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratory testing of Soviet food late last year because no abnormal radiation levels were detected. "We didn't find anything so we stopped doing it," a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipment remained in the embassy waiting room for British residents in Moscow who wanted to check their food, but laboratory tests had not been conducted for several months. "Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as a precautionary measure, but we stopped in the absence of any alarming signals," he said. "If the tests had shown abnormal readings, they would have been resumed." Reuter 
BP SAYS NO PLANS TO CLOSE SWEDISH REFINERY

The British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> said it had no plans to close its refinery in Gothenburg, despite forecasts by a Swedish finance ministry committee that it might be planning such a move.

But BP said the unit, in which Sweden's <OK Petroleum AB> has a 22 pct stake, had performed well both technically and financially up to and including the first quarter of 1987. Current restrictions on sulphur emissions and known future plans for both Sweden and export markets did not cause it any serious problems, it said in a statement.

EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND

The European Commission's decision to release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said. Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage, pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes were granted. The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm. The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission. There has been growing concern that rising internal prices, triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in interior markets. The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month. The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and June. News of the release produced an early downward reaction in local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved early two stg losses while others were unchanged. Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the free market. However, some traders believe these figures are overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off the market in futures stores. A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been sold for export or to the home market since the season started July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59 mln tonnes. Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said. This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all early expectations and has created the present nervous situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in August. The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes achieved in the 1984/85 season. Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and barley around 4.50 mln tonnes. The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28 mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders said. Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season. The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said. Reuter 
CHILE, CHINA TO ESTABLISH PEKING COPPER PLANT

The Chilean state copper corporation, Codelco, the privately-owned Chilean copper fabricator Madeco and Chinese interests are to establish a copper tube plant in Peking, Codelco's U.K. Subsidiary Chile Copper Ltd said. The plant is designed to produce 5,000 tonnes in the first five years and 8,000 tonnes as from year six. Total investment is estimated at 10 mln dlrs, of which the Chileans will contribute two mln. Codelco and Madeco have formed the Chilean Wrought Copper Company to take a 50 pct stake in a new company called Peking Santiago Tube Company with the Chinese holding the other half. Reuter 
BRITAIN'S ECGD DISCUSSING NEW COVER FOR NIGERIA

Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) is holding talks with Nigeria aimed at resuming insurance cover for British exporters to Nigeria, the head of ECGD's international debt division, Gerry Breach, said. The ECGD suspended cover on Nigeria in 1984 after the country fell into arrears on payments of insured and uninsured debts. Following last week's bilateral accord between Britain and Nigeria to reschedule the country's insured trade debts, bankers had hoped that talks would commence on a resumption of cover. Breach made his comments in an address to a private meeting of businessmen, a copy of which was made available to the press. Breach noted that for the ECGD to consider "a gradual introduction of a package of new support" certain criteria would have to be met. This would involve the Nigerian economic structural adjustment program being put into effect and being endorsed by the International Monetary Fund, the program remaining on course and continuing to be endorsed by the IMF and a satisfactory level of acceptance by the Nigerian government of the ECGD insured short-term trade arrears. Breach said that these criteria are now beginning to be satisfied, adding that while the ECGD could not yet formally announce new cover, it was holding discussions with Nigeria on priorities for new credits. He said an announcement would be made "as soon as possible" on an agreement and the ECGD would create a package for Nigeria that would include the department's normal range of export trade support facilities. British exports to Nigeria exceeded 550 mln stg in 1986. Breach noted that since cover was removed, the ECGD has maintained a limited amount of short-term trade cover for Nigeria, which was backed by letters of credit from the Nigerian Central Bank. While the ECGD would initially continue to use this structure under a new package, it would also hope to expand the volume of coverage in the short-term area and relax the terms it is prepared to underwrite towards the commonly accepted maximum of 180 days.

LAWSON SAYS U.K. ELECTION NOT ONLY EMS BAR

British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the only element standing in the way of full British membership of the European Monetary System (EMS). But he added that arguments against joining had weakened. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest. But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers' meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership. In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS's core exchange rate mechanism, there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered, he said. British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system, he noted. "We have to make sure it would work." But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem. As an example he cited sterling's role as a petrocurrency, which he said was diminishing. "That argument has clearly weakened," he said. Lawson restated that the government was keeping the question of membership under review. REUTER 
BARCLAYS DE ZOETE WEDD SETS UP AMSTERDAM OFFICE

British securities house <Barclays de Zoete Wedd>, BZW, said it would open today a subsidiary office in Amsterdam, its first office in continental Europe. BZW, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barclays Plc <BCS.L>, said in a statement the new company had been built on the parent company's former Dutch subsidiary, Barclays Kol. The new company, <Barclays de Zoete Wedd Nederland NV>, will focus on trading in both Dutch and international equities and will develop a full range of investment banking services. It will initially employ 29, aiming to increase numbers to 35 by the year-end, it said. BZW said its parent Barclays Bank had subsidiary companies active on the stock exchanges of Zurich, Milan and Paris which BZW planned to use to strengthen its presence in continental Europe. Commenting on the move, BZW chairman Sir Martin Jacombe said while international deregulation had turned London, New York and Tokyo into "pivotal points for trading across time zones, firms like BZW that seek to serve the world-wide financial community must have a presence in Europe, not just in the U.K." BZW currently employs some 2,000 staff in its offices in Britain, Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York and Sydney.

BRITISH OPINION POLLS CONFIRM THATCHER LEAD

Public opinion polls showing a surge in support for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher following her trip to Moscow have raised the possibility she will call a spring election, political analysts said. A poll in today's Daily Express showed 39 pct support for the ruling Conservative party, 30 pct for the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats and 29 pct for the Labour party. Reproduced in a general election, the result would give Thatcher an overall parliamentary majority of 22. A poll in yesterday's Sunday Times gave the Conservatives 41 pct support, 12 percentage points ahead of both opposition groups -- their biggest lead in three-and-a-half years. Conservative sources have said Thatcher would prefer a series of polls giving her party over 40 pct of the vote, securing it a clear parliamentary majority, before announcing the date for the next election. Lord Whitelaw, Conservative leader in the House of Lords and one of Thatcher's closest advisors, yesterday ruled out a May general election, but left open the choices of June and early autumn. The Sunday Times poll, taken during Thatcher's visit to Moscow last week, was the first to show the party breaking through 40 pct. The Express poll was the first since Thatcher's trip to Moscow, hailed as a triumph by the British media. It confirmed a number of recent surveys suggesting that the Alliance had overtaken Labour. Thatcher, currently serving her second consecutive term of office, does not have to call elections until June 1988 but is widely expected to do so within the next six months. REUTER 

COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE

The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said. Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 "must buy" level. Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations, traders said. Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1,600 SDR "must buy" level. The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per tonne yesterday. Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and September, but these are set to change to July, September and December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot month, traders noted. The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market. But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the indicator which governs his activities, traders said. "The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa," an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said. Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln. A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87 world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94,000 tonnes, traders said. In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the "must buy" level. But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market. The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action, dealers said. Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin. But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material. Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said. Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures. Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying, dealers said. "The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas," one trader said. Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were "all prognostication" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure. In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism. REUTER 

BP SCOTTISH REFINERY SET TO RESTART THIS WEEK

The British Petroleum <BP.L> Co Plc's refinery at Grangemouth, Scotland, shut down after an explosion and fire in the hydrocracker on March 22, will probably be back in operation towards the week-end, a refinery spokesman said. He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500 barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January, will not be completed before the end of April. He said the refinery had been closed for longer than originally expected due to the lengthy safety checks being carried out prior to restarting. The explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be out of operation for several months. The remainder of the refinery, including the 19,000 catalytic cracker, was undamaged. He said inquiries into the accident, which happened while the hydrocracker was not in operation, were continuing. In an earlier incident, two people were killed in an explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13. REUTER 

THATCHER FIRM AS PRESSURE MOUNTS FOR ELECTIONS

As pressure mounted on British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to call a June election, she said today that the decision on when to go to the county was hers and hers alone. She was speaking to parliament after senior members of the ruling Conservative Party urged her to call elections due in June 1988 a year early in the wake of two more opinion polls giving her party a commanding lead. Asked by a Conservative back-bencher for an assurance that the decision was hers alone, and did not depend on "media hype, pressure and speculation," she replied: "The date of the next election will be decided by Downing Street, not Fleet Street." Downing Street is the Prime Minister's official residence, Fleet Street the traditional home of the British national press. A Harris poll for the breakfast-time program TV-AM gave the Tories 43 pct of the vote, representing a majority of 132 seats in parliament, their biggest lead since the party's landslide victory in the 1983 elections. In The Times of London, a MORI poll gave the Tories a 92 seat majority. It was the sixth poll to show the ruling party with a big lead over the opposition Labour Party and the fast-improving centrist Alliance. Leading the chorus urging Thatcher to go to the polls in June, Sir Marcus Fox, vice-chairman of the influential 1922 committee of Conservative back-benchers, said: "I have always felt that it would be June, and this reinforces my view. "I always thought June was right. We have got most of our legislation through and to go beyond that I do not think would be in the national interest." Another Tory back-bencher, Anthony Beaumont-Dark, said: "I have always been an October man, but I think it would be good to get it out of the way now." Their comments came as government officials dismissed speculation about a snap election to coincide with local polls in May, timed to reap maximum advantage from the recent popularity surge, Thatcher's successful trip to Moscow and Labour's current popularity slump. Calls for a May poll were also prompted by Tory concern over a steady advance by the Alliance, and the possibility that if it continues it could rob the Conservatives of an overall majority in parliament. Today's MORI poll showed an Alliance gain of eight points over the past month in around 100 key marginal seats where the outcome of the next election is likely to be decided. Reuter 

LIFFE, AFTER RECORD VOLUMES, SEES MORE GROWTH

The records in turnover set by the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) in March could be surpassed in the coming months, Liffe Chief Executive Michael Jenkins said. Last month, Liffe saw record monthly futures volume at 1.15 mln lots, and record monthly options volume at 97,700. Total Liffe volume in first quarter 1987 rose to 2.8 mln contracts, or 89 pct up on the same 1986 period. Long gilt turnover in first quarter 1987 was 300 pct up on the year-ago period at 1.63 mln lots versus 409,500. But T-bond volume fell by 38 pct to 244,500 in first three months 1987. Jenkins told Reuters the higher volumes for gilts reflected in part the volatility in the U.K. Markets in recent months, while the falloff in T-bonds was an indication of the relative stability of U.S. Credit markets. Jenkins said he saw room for the whole financial futures sector to grow further in the coming months. In particular, FT- SE 100 futures had great scope for expansion, and turnover in them should be much higher by end 1987. FT-SE futures volume was 62,700 in first quarter 1987, an increase of 124 pct over the 28,000 contracts recorded in the same months of 1986. Institutions here had been slow to find out about the use of stock exchange futures, but they would now learn more, Jenkins predicted. Commenting on the difference in popularity between gilts and bonds, Jenkins said Liffe had designed the widest possible variety of contracts so that at any given time, at least one sector would be volatile enough to attract trading. The current situation of U.S. Markets being steady, and U.K. Ones changeable, might alter completely in coming months. A further boost to Liffe's volume and attractiveness should come with the introduction of yen bond futures, he added. REUTER 

EC SOURCES SAY UK WHEAT PLAN YET TO BE APPROVED

The European Commission has not taken a decision on applications from the British government for the release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the British market in May and June, Commission sources said. They said last week's cereals management committee agreed to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23. However, it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later. The British government had applied for the release of a further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British intervention stores to prevent market prices rising. However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review the market situation nearer the time before giving its approval. The Commission was given new powers last year to control the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the sources noted. Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes, depending on the state of the market. This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission had actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the three months of April, May and June at last week's meeting. Reuter 

NICKEL PRICES UNLIKELY TO RISE MUCH - SHEARSON

Nickel prices are unlikely to rise significantly from current levels unless further steps are taken to reduce production, Shearson Lehman Brothers said in its quarterly nickel market report. The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb yesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January, due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but Shearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year's buoyant levels, which should ease current tightness. Output reductions by producers will take effect later this year but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere. Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in balance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at 556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in 1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports from Socialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000). It forecast prices will edge higher during the year from a first quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in the last quarter. The year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lb compared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using London Metal Exchange cash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987 sterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.

Iraq said today its forces had beaten back the latest attacks inflicting heavy casualties. Mousavi told Tehran radio that "on the whole, our advances have broken the back of the military forces of Saddam." Earlier today the Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehran's forces were stabilising new positions after their assault on Iraqi lines defending Basra, Iraq's second city. In Baghdad, a military spokesman said Iraqi warplanes today destroyed an oil pumping station and a production unit at Iran's Ahvaz field. Reuter 
COCOA TERMINAL DEPOSITS TO BE CUT 25 PCT - ICCH

The basic deposit on cocoa futures contracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday, April 10, taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stg from 400 previously, a spokesman for the International Commodity Clearing House (ICCH) said. The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to 150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said. The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations over a period of weeks, he said, adding the market's basic stability had warranted a cut in deposit rates. The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH after consultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market, the spokesman said. The cuts were likely to attract more business to the market, he said.

TALKS CONTINUE ON TIN AGREEMENT EXTENSION

Discussions on the possible extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement (ITA) began at the quarterly session of the International Tin Council (ITC) but the Council is still waiting for decisions from various member states. A number of producer governments in particular have not decided their final position on whether the ITA should be extended for up to two years or wound down after it expires on June 30, according to delegate sources. Earlier today European Community (EC) members decided to back an extension, with the exception of Britain, which undertook to communicate its decision to its EC partners later. Delegates said it could be Friday before all the member countries declare their positions on the possible extension. Today's full Council session started shortly before 1500 GMT after the scheduled 1330 start was delayed by an EC coordination meeting. The council reconvenes at 0930 GMT tomorrow, although delegates said the morning is likely to be taken up with minor technical matters and the main issue will probably not be discussed before the afternoon session.

LONDON FREIGHT MARKET FEATURES GRAIN OUT OF U.S.

Moderately active grain fixing was reported out of the U.S. But none of the business involved the significant voyages to the Continent or Japan, ship brokers said. A steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the U.S. Gulf to Morocco and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the Gulf to Taiwan. A vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat flour from the Gulf to Aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500 dlrs. Grain from the Great Lakes to Algeria made 28 dlrs against 27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of March. Market talk suggested a Federal Commerce vessel had been booked to move grain from the Great Lakes to Morocco on Comanav account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of oilseeds from British Columbia to Japan, but no confirmation was obtainable. On the Continent, shippers agreed 19 dlrs for wheat from La Pallice to Buenaventura and 10.75 dlrs for grain from Ghent to Naples/Venice range. Elsewhere, maize from East London to Japan paid 22 dlrs. Soviet charterers reappeared in the timecharter sector and secured a 30,000 tonner from Savona for a trans-Atlantic round trip at 4,450 dlrs daily and a 31,000 tonner from Antwerp-Hamburg for a similar voyage at 4,250 dlrs daily.

LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS

Lead prices have risen this week against a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders said. Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying or if labour problems develop in North America, they added. London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and prices tending to drift lower. This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed. The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off, stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders said. The lower supply levels result from a number of different factors around the globe. Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have been drawing on LME stocks. In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie, South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks. And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and a regular supplier to the world market. Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks, have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said. On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying order was filled by merchants in March. Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said. On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each, and this is believed to be in strong hands. Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses which are not popular with merchants putting together shipments. But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on the transport of used batteries. Labour negotiations in North America will play an important part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C., Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter. Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months. Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at midsession. Reuter 

U.K. POTATO FUTURES TRADING NOT TO BE SUSPENDED

Trading on the London potato futures market will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of the London Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statement to floor members. It was in response to strong representations by the Potato Marketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion of price which they say will result in large deliveries into the physical market when the April futures position expires. The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futures trading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore the relationship between futures and physicals. Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering of the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigations by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), the International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and other parties, found no evidence to substantiate this. The main complaint from some sections of the physical market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over the PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded this morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB's average price of 104 stg. Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is a two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said quality potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesser quality grades have traded below 100 stg. Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered against the April futures contract between now and the end of the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market. Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation. Reuter 
SPOT TIN EASIER ON EUROPEAN FREE MARKET

Spot tin on the European free market was indicated in the easier range 4,200 to 4,230 stg per tonne, for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam, down 20 stg from yesterday's afternoon kerb close. Stability in sterling versus the dollar continued to apply pressure to a market which is coming close to testing a psychological chart support base at 4,200 stg, traders said. Dealers said major consumers still need to cover their May and June requirements but are holding out for even lower offers. Reported high grade tin business in London was confined to end April metal at 4,225 stg. Small-scale spot business was reported by West German operators at 12.60 and 12.63 marks per kilo although the market was still being undercut by Chinese material, which traded at one stage down to 12.54 marks per kilo, traders said.

U.K. MARCH PRODUCER PRICES RISE 0.3 PCT

The price index for sales of manufactured goods in the U.K. Rose a provisional, unadjusted 0.3 pct in March after an identical rise in February, Department of Trade and Industry figures show. The index for materials and fuel purchased by manufacturing industry fell a provisional and unadjusted 1.1 pct after a 1.7 pct fall in February. The Department said the year-on-year rise in producer prices in March was a provisional 3.7 pct, compared with a provisional 4.2 pct increase in the year to end-February. The index for output prices, non-seasonally adjusted, was put at a provisional 149.7 in March after 149.3 in February. The index for input prices, also not seasonally adjusted, was set at 128.2 in March after February's 129.6. The 1.1 pct fall in input prices between February and March was mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricity costs and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, the Department said. The Department said these falls were only partly offset by a rise in prices of home-produced food manufacturing materials. The seasonally adjusted index for input prices showed a 0.2 pct rise between February and March. Year-on-year, the input price index was down 0.7 pct in March after a 2.8 pct drop in February.

The London Metal Exchange (LME) has issued a note clarifying details on its new high grade aluminium contract, in response to questions from members following the announcement of the contract, due to start June 1. All deliverable shapes of aluminium under the high grade primary aluminium contract (minimum 99.7 pct purity) will also be deliverable against the standard primary aluminium contract (min 99.5 pct), the LME said. Sows will not constitute good delivery against the standard contract until September 1, and 99.5 pct purity sows are not good delivery and cannot be placed on LME warrant. The dollar quotation for the high grade contract will be in multiples of one U.S. Dollar but carries may be made at 50 cents for even tonnages only.

U.K. PRODUCER PRICES SEEN MOVED BY TECHNICALITIES

U.K. Producer price data for March were roughly as expected after taking into account technical factors which affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analysts said. The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonally adjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged from February and close to the average for the last six months. The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pct in February. But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected a rise in excise duties which affected the index in March last year. He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into the monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in April would take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct. Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' input prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors such as a fall in industrial electricity costs. Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures were slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected. Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep input costs down over the next few months, although Tinker added that last year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the year-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return to rises in the index rather than falls.

BRITAIN CALLS FOR FIGHT AGAINST PROTECTIONISM

British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe called on industrial and developing countries to combat trade protectionism and remove barriers which impede free trading in agricultural products. Howe said in an address to the annual meeting of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) that success in fighting protectionism hinges on the current Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said Britain is committed to resisting and combatting protectionism because free trade is vital to Britain where 30 pct of the gnp comes from trade in goods and services. Howe urged developing countries to open up their markets, remove measures distorting free trade in services and provide protection for intellectual property rights. He said industrial nations should also adopt macro-economic policies which help reduce trade imbalances and promote stable currency relationships. Howe said the agricultural industry, plagued by surpluses and falling commodity prices in recent years, is over subsidised and over protected. But the problem of farm surpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it is politically difficult for any government to reverse the trend of growing farm subsidies. "This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection of agriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need the sustained application of all our energy and our imagination to find solutions," Howe said.

GERMAN INTERVENTION SUGAR FOR EXPORT - LDN TRADE

The most likely reason for West German producers withdrawing white sugar from intervention stores is that they already have, or are reasonably certain of, obtaining European Community (EC) export licences for it, traders said. They were responding to EC Commission sources in Brussels saying West German producers have withdrawn most of the 79,250 tonnes of the sugar they put into intervention on April 1. The traders said it is also likely that French producers, who put over 700,000 tonnes into intervention, will withdraw a significant proportion of this for the same reason before they are due to accept payment for the sugar in early May. Earlier this week traders said the stepping up of the level of export licences being granted by the EC at recent tenders, with generous subsidies, had been due to producer threats to leave the sugar in intervention and to a desire to move most of the old crop sugar before the new crop tenders start in May. The EC has so far granted licences for 2,467,970 tonnes out of around 3.1 mln tonnes targetted for export in the 1986/87 series of tenders. This would indicate the likelihood of high tonnages continuing to be moved over the next few tenders and subsidies also remaining high in order to attract producer bids for the export licences, traders said.

EC MINISTERS LIKELY TO CRITICISE FINANCE IDEAS

Plans for a new-style European Community (EC) free of damaging budget wrangles receive their first full review from EC foreign ministers today, but are unlikely to gather much support. Diplomats said key EC capitals would voice strong criticism of proposals that would lead to a sharp increase in EC budget payments by bringing member states" contributions more into line with national wealth. They said the EC"s current paymasters, Britain, France, and West Germany, would lead the opposition to the plans, designed to enable the community meet the challenges of the 1990s. Faced with a budget deficit this year of at least five billion dlrs, EC Commission President Jacques Delors called in February for a radical overhaul of the EC financing system. Such action was necessary, he argued, to end a damaging cycle of annual budget crises and ensure cash for technological research programs and regional and social spending projects. Ironically, diplomats said, the move could spark exactly the type of row it was intended to avoid with industrially developed northern states demanding assurances the new cash would not be swallowed up by the poorer southern members. Delors" plans, by linking a country"s contributions to its Gross National Product (GNP), would over the next five years add some 18 billion dlrs to the present budget of 34 billion. Currently, contributions are calculated on a percentage of Value Added Tax (VAT) returns. Under the new scheme, all countries would pay one pct of their VAT receipts to Brussels. Extra cash would then be raised in line with needs by a levy on the difference between a country"s total VAT receipts and its GNP. London is one of the most resolutely opposed countries to the scheme, arguing instead that money should be made available from deep cutbacks in the EC"s heavily-subsidised farm sector. Unofficially many EC capitals secretly support the wearisome budget wrangling, taking the line that the highly diverse 12-nation Community can only take tough decisions when forced to do so. The issue is further complicated by a possible general election in Britain and acceptance that the EC problems cannot seriously be addressed by London until those polls are out of the way. REUTER 

TOWNSEND FERRY INQUIRY TOLD BOW DOORS TO BLAME

The Zeebrugge ferry disaster, in which around 200 people drowned seven weeks ago, was almost certainly caused by the ship leaving port with its bow doors wide open, a British government inquiry was told. Lawyer David Steel, representing the government, told the opening session of a public inquiry into the March 6 tragedy that this was "the only tenable explanation." The ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, is owned by Townsend Thoresen, part of P and O's <PORL.L> subsidiary European Ferries Group. Steel, commissioner of wrecks for England and Wales, said the inquiry would probably conclude that the ferry capsized in calm seas and fair weather a mile outside the Belgian port when water poured into the car deck. "We think you will also conclude that the immediate cause of that was that the doors were open, he said. Steel told the tribunal it appeared no attempt was made to close either the inner or outer bow doors prior to what should have been a routine voyage to the English port of Dover, despite a provision in the ship's "Stability Booklet" that the doors were to be closed and kept closed.

Britain is not considering any restriction of its present oil production, UK Energy Minister Alick Buchanan-Smith said. Speaking to reporters at the Offshore Technology Conference, Buchanan-Smith said, "No, we've made that absolutely clear, we see no reason for changing (the production level)." Earlier today, Buchanan-Smith gave the go-ahead to Mobil Corp for two new North Sea developments -- the Ness oil field and Beryl B subsea water injection project -- totalling 96 mln dlrs (60 mln British pounds). Unlike Norway, which has restricted its production of North Sea oil by 80,000 barrels a day in an effort to stabilize world oil prices, Britain has consistently refused to intervene in the market place. Buchanan-Smith also said there may be a demand-supply gap in the 1990s for natural gas in Britain, but added that it would probably be less than had been previously estimated. Norway is a major producer of natural gas and this morning Norway's Energy Minister Arne Oien said he was hoping Britain will take more Norwegian gas in the 1990s. Buchanan-Smith also said he expects to announce the results of the 10th licensing round of North Sea tracts next month.

U.K. ECONOMY STRONGER THAN AT BUDGET, LAWSON SAYS

The U.K. Economy looks stronger than it did only last month, when the government unveiled its budget for fiscal 1987/88, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He told Parliament that "all the indicators that have been published since the budget confirm that, if anything, we are doing even better than I suggested then." The budget was unveiled on March 17. "The PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing Requirement) has come out lower than I forecast in the Budget. Inflation, too, is lower than I suggested ... (and) the current account of the balance of payments is also performing better, so far, than I predicted." The budget foresaw inflation easing to 4.0 pct at the end of this year after peaking at around 4.5 pct. Lawson said at the time that the overall 1986/87 PSBR would be around 4.0 billion stg. It was in fact lower, at 3.3 billion stg. He had also projected average GDP growth in calendar 1987 of 3.0 pct after 2.5 pct in 1986. Lawson today said "output appears to be rising, if anything, rather faster." Speaking during a House of Commons debate, he said, "by the end of this year we will have registered the longest period of steady growth, at close to 3.0 pct a year, that the British economy has known since the (Second World) War." The 1987/88 budget contained a proposal to cut the basic rate of taxation by two pence, to 27 pence in the pound. Lawson today reaffirmed that the government aimed to further cut the standard rate to "no more than 25p." He said that that objective "should not take too long to achieve." Turning to policies proposed by political opposition parties, Lawson said those advocated by the Labour Party would entail extra public expenditure of some 34 billion stg. That, he said, "would require either a doubling of the basic rates of income tax or more than trebling the standard rate of (valued added tax) VAT," which is currently 15 pct. On value added tax, Lawson noted that the Conservative government promised back in 1984 not to extend VAT to food. "Beyond that, the incidence of taxation has to be determined in the light of the budgetary needs at the time, and no responsible government could conceivably take any other position," he said. Labour MPs have accused the Conservatives of planning VAT increases for some essential consumer goods. Lawson reiterated his belief that reductions in taxation can often produce higher, not lower, revenues "thus leading to the scope for still further reductions in taxation." Lawson said "inheritance tax is expected this year to yield almost 50 pct more in real terms than Capital Transfer Tax did in 1978-79. The yield of Capital Gains Tax is forecast to be 80 pct higher in real terms, and Stamp Duty up by 140 pct." He said that "the greatly increased yield of Corporation Tax, reflecting greatly increased company profitability, is clearly connected with the reform of Corporation Taxation I introduced in 1984, which brought the rate of tax on company profits in this country to the lowest in the industrialised world."

IRAN'S NAVY CHIEF THREATENS GULF CLOSURE

Iran's navy commander warned that Iran would close off the Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf, if there was any disruption to its shipping or sea-bound trade, Tehran radio said. Commodore Mohammed Hoseyn Malekzadegan told a news conference Iran was ready to maintain security in the Gulf. But he added "If there is any disruption in the movement of our ships and our imports and exports, this waterway would not be left open for any country."

He said it had also expanded operations to cover the whole region "from the most northerly point in the Persian Gulf to the most southerly part of the Sea of Oman." Referring to U.S. fleet movements in and near the Gulf, Malekzadegan said they had so far not been directed against Iran's interests. "Their movements have been on the basis of international regulations and in the open seas," the radio quoted him as saying. "However, if any movement or action is carried out against the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran in whatever context, we shall decisively confront that move." Reuter 
EC URGED TO ACT QUICKLY ON EUROPEAN AIRFARE CUTS

The European Commission should make urgent and concrete proposals to break the deadlock over moves to cut sky-high European airfares, an independent report said. The report by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) said costs, fares and profits on international services within Europe are the highest in the world although European airlines are less efficient and not perceptibly safer than their cheaper U.S. Equivalents. "The European airlines protect their position through the secrecy they maintain over the costs and profits of any group of services," the report said. The airlines also protect themselves through "the ferocity with which (they) resist any relaxation of the monopolistic practices which protect their profits," the report said. Britain, a strong advocate of deregulation, has been trying to push measures to introduce greater competition among Europe's airlines but negotiations foundered at the end of 1986 over discount and deep discount fares. The IEA report said European governments and the Commission, the EC executive authority, had been extraordinarily lax about the airlines' secretiveness, showing "a lack of concern for the interests of the traveller."

U.K. BANKERS CONSIDER NEW ECGD FINANCING PLAN

Representatives of major U.K. Based banks are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources said. The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD and the Bank of England. Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium term credit portfolio in the international capital markets. The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size and maturity of the credit and the currency. The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another cost reduction plan. At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing government backed credit in the capital markets. On credits that are refinanced an original lender would receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions. REUTER 

COCOA ORIGINS DISMAYED BY BUFFER STOCK ACTION

Traders recently returned from West Africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases. One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows. So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted, only on an intermittent basis. They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him. The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers. London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price). However, little progress has been made in that direction, and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously. The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said. Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers, they observed. A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities. In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes. Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes. Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271. It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said. Reuter 

CNP OF PORTUGAL MANDATES 250 MLN DLR LOAN

Companhia Nacional de Petroquimica EP (CNP), the Portugese state-owned oil refinery and petrochemicals company, has awarded a mandate to Bank of America International Ltd and Manufacturers Hanover Ltd to arrange a 250 mln dlr loan, banking sources said. The loan will be for eight years and proceeds will be used to refinance existing debt. Interest will be at 12.5 basis points above the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) for the first four years, with the margin rising to 15 basis points in the last four years. No other fees were immediately available. Bankers noted that CNP has faced significant financial problems over the past year as a result of investments in areas which proved to be unprofitable. Portugal is attempting to maintain its position in the petrochemical industry and is undertaking a restructuring of CNP, which involves the divestment of certain unprofitable assets. Partly because of these problems, the new loan carries a "letter of support and assumption" under which the Republic would assume the obligations of CNP should it be unable to meet any payments or cease to exist. Furthermore, bankers noted that this financing covers all of CNP's existing debt, some of which was state-guaranteed but some of which was not. The existing loans had maturities of about seven to 10 years and carried interest margins of between 3/8 and 5/8 pct. By consolidating the loans and covering them with the Republic's support, the borrower was able to obtain a reduction in the margins on the new loan, bankers said. REUTER 
U.K. RESERVES RISE UNDERLYING 4.8 BILLION DLRS IN MAY, (2.9 BILLION APRIL) - OFFICIAL



U.K. RESERVES SHOW RECORD UNDERLYING RISE IN MAY

Britain's gold and currency reserves rose a record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April's 2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said. The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank of England intervention on currency markets to curb sterling's strength. It was above market expectations which had been for a rise of between one billion and three billion dlrs. The Treasury declined comment on the figures. Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, compared with April's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68 billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April. Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mln dlrs, against April's 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were 85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments of eight mln, after three mln last month. Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs. The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings and repayments. It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrs rise seen in October 1977.

The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K. Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11 general election, market analysts said. Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said. But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now available to the authorities to support the pound should curb any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added. "We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we have done hitherto," Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the record reserves rise. He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign exchanges. "We have been playing a very full part ourselves," he said. But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down its rise, more in the light of local factors. Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities, said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out. U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said. Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound. Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0 pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released. "The market doesn't want to do anything because of the election," commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank. Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the forward market. The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention reported in May probably occurred in April, they said. The key three months interbank money market rates eased about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves news, analysts said. Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was muted as traders worried about the funding implications of another huge rise in reserves, they added. Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove accurate, with another half point later. Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be possible. "Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future, rather than this active intervention," he predicted. Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut looked likely. A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out. "The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And has signalled some worry about broad money (growth)," said Robin Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities. He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the European Monetary System. But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10 or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in. REUTER 

LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL

The scale of foreign exchange intervention the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawson told reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange rate stability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if he favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels. May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention. In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg. Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have been playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitments toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris. "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added. Asked which techniques were available to preserve stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and interest rate changes could be used to tackle "the market pressures there are from time to time." "Interest rate stability is not an objective in that sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added. Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" by draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new issues of government securities and foreign currency sales, when the market allowed. This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention, he said. "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawson said. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale." REUTER 

TIGHT FAR EAST FREIGHT SPACE HITS SUGAR MARKET

The Far Eastern sugar market is being hit by a tightening in available nearby freight space needed to move raw sugar to various destinations, notably from Thailand, traders said. This has resulted in a hardening of freight rates in those areas. These are now being quoted between 12.5 and 17.5 dlrs a tonne per day, depending on shipment and destination, against recent fixings below 12 dlrs a tonne. Charterers are considering combining contracted shipments because of inadequate space, shipping sources said, noting 13 raws cargoes are awaiting shipment from various ports.

ICCO BUFFER TO BUY 3,000 TONNES COCOA JUNE 3

The buffer stock manager of the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) will tender for about 3,000 tonnes of cocoa beans Wednesday, June 3, the ICCO said in a statement. It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the previous announcement. These conditions are that offers from registered companies should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard differentials have been set in the ICCO's buffer stock rules, and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and spot to December arrival/delivery. The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate carrying costs will be taken into account. The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case of offers emanating from the origins. The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from "cif landed" and 38.00 pounds sterling from "cif shipping weights" to "in store") and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00 pounds sterling per month, the ICCO said. No more than four offers will be considered from each offering party, it added. Reuter 
NO PROSPECT IN SIGHT OF EC BUDGET ACCORD

The European Community was set to plunge into an ever-deepening budget crisis after ministers failed to reach agreement on plugging a gap in the near-bankrupt Community's finances, diplomats said. As EC budget ministers ended six hours of talks in Luxembourg, diplomats said there was little basis for an accord amongst the trading bloc's 12 member states. The EC executive Commission says the Community faces a deficit this year of at least five billion European Currency Units and could be forced to choose between massive spending cuts or bankruptcy. It has appealed to member states to pay an extra 1.5 billion ECUs to help meet the deficit, caused by soaring farm spending and falling revenues. But hardliners Britain and West Germany have insisted that there can be no extra cash for the Community this year and instead call for a clampdown on farm spending, which absorbs two thirds of the EC budget. "We have to make clear that expenses should be based on income," West German Minister of State Hans Tietmeyer told reporters. "There is no way the Germans will agree to extra financing in the form of national contributions," he added. A second Commission proposal, which would plug most of the budget gap by paying member states in arrears rather than in advance for their spending on Community farm policies, was also far from agreement, diplomats added. The proposal, strongly backed by Britain and West Germany, would save up to four billion ECUs if payments were delayed for two months. But poorer member states, which would have to borrow funds to cover the delay, complain the change in the system would unfairly impose too much of the burden on them. The European Parliament is also expected to refuse an early debate on the changeover in the farm payments system, further delaying any moves to solve the deficit problem, parliamentary sources said.

STRONG DEMAND FOR PERU BISMUTH IN JAN/MAY

Very strong demand from all markets including, recently, Japan has resulted in Peru's bismuth exports showing an impressive increase in January/May 1987, Peru's state owned mining industry's marketing arm Minpeco S.A. Said. In a statement released by its London office, Minpeco said Peruvian customs figures for bismuth exports for the first five months were 574.8 tonnes compared with 160.7 tonnes in the same period of 1986 and 483.4 tonnes during the whole of 1986, Minpeco said. A breakdown of the figures showed Peru exported 296.4 tonnes of bismuth to the U.S. During Jan/May 1987 compared with 127.0 during the whole of 1986. Other recipients were Peoples Republic of China 110.4 (100.0), Holland 100.2 (150.0), USSR 50.0 (50.0) and other areas 17.8 tonnes (56.4). Sales to the U.K., West Germany, France and other Western and Eastern European countries are hidden under the heading Holland as Minpeco sells to customers in these countries from stocks the company normally holds in Rotterdam, the statement said.

CAOBISCO CONDEMNS EC OILS AND FATS TAX PROPOSAL

The proposed European Community (EC) levy on oils and fats has been criticised by CAOBISCO, the association of EC biscuit, chocolate and confectionery manufacturers. In a letter to the President of the Council of Ministers, M. Eyskens, the association said the tax would cost the EC biscuit, cake, chocolate and confectionery industries almost 200 mln European currency units per year. The tax also was contrary to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and could prompt U.S. Retaliatory measures on EC exports, CAOBISCO said. In a parallel move the British Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionery Alliance has written to U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson urging him to oppose the levy. President Charles Gillett said the tax was extending the Commission's powers by allowing it to set levels of consumer taxation, an area previously reserved for national treasuries. Reuter 

U.K. Unemployment fell a record provisional, seasonally-adjusted 64,300 in May to a total 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, the Employment Department said. In April, seasonally-adjusted unemployment fell by an upwardly revised 21,600 to 3.02 mln or 10.9 pct, it said. The unadjusted jobless total in May, including school leavers, alos fell a record 121,000 to 2.99 mln or 10.8 pct from April's 3.11 mln, 11.2 pct. May was the eleventh successive decline from a peak last summer of 11.6 pct, the Employment Department said. "Unemployment has fallen to under three mln for the first time in over three years. The May fall of 64,000 was the largest drop since records were first kept (in 1948)," Employment Minister Norman Fowler said. All regions have seen above average falls in long term unemployment during the past year, he added.

VESSEL LOST IN PACIFIC WAS CARRYING LEAD

The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore, a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said. He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved. Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates. Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low stocks. Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this depended on the quality of the concentrates. A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply pipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Supplies there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at one major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being held at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining and Smelting Ltd.

OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS

Some OPEC states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say. They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive. There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes, to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices. But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity. "All OPEC members can make a good case for changing differentials," said one analyst with a major oil company. "But at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be "leave well alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered." Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases, marketing incentives have helped their sales. Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a "package." Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985 when members offered discounts to attract customers. OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8 mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months. Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials, analysts say. The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest. Extra heavy crudes were among those left out. Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at official prices, with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products. Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year, when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices. Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel -- was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent. In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived, due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has risen. Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel. But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the differentials question in Vienna. "It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which holds the presidency, raised the issue," he said. REUTER 
U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS

Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current nine pct further into the distance, analysts said. A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing production data showed that the economy is still strong and does not need a fillip from lower rates. News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually, taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist arguments against easier credit, they said. "The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near term," said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall. Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K. Rates. It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's strength. The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying average earnings in April, dealers said. The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset the impact on domestic money supply of its current intervention. "The gilt market reaction was correct," said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew. "That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very good state indeed," Skeoch said. "There's no reason to get worries about inflationary pressures because they're very subdued." Unit wage cost rises were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings which were potentially inflationary, he added. "I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major problem," agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall. But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried about the funding implications of recent intervention. He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system. However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal higher inflation this year. "Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As long as that continues we're okay," he added. REUTER 

U.K. COURT RULES AGAINST RTZ ON OIL FIELD COSTS

The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's <RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible, the Press Association reported. The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax Commissioners that any such provision was a capital expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible. The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of abandoning a rig. An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible from corporation tax payable. It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he said. Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was shared by the industry as a whole. The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were built into the accounts, one analyst added.

S. AFRICAN UNION OBJECTS TO PLANNED MATTHEY MOVE

A South African trade union is in dispute with a subsidiary of Britain's Johnson Matthey Plc over the company's proposal to move a platinum refinery near Johannesburg to a black tribal homeland. The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers Industrial Union said it fears the planned move to the Bophuthatswana homeland, where South African unions are not recognised, could lead to job losses and affect wages. A mass dismissal last year at the Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd <IPLA.J> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinum prices rocketing. The union said talks with management over the proposed move had broken down. It said an earlier ballot of refinery workers showed that most favoured striking over the move but added that no final decision had been taken on strike action. The refinery processes all platinum metals of Rustenburg Platinum Holdings Ltd, the world's largest platinum producer. It is owned by Matthey Rustenburg Ltd, a joint-subsidiary of Johnson Matthey and Rustenburg which, in turn, is owned by mining group Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co Ltd. Reuter 

ITC CONTESTS USE OF DOCUMENTS AS COURT EVIDENCE

The International Tin Council, ITC, intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent the presentation of internal Council documents as evidence. The intervention in Shearson Lehman's action against the London Metal Exchange over its "ring out" of tin contracts in 1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in which the Council is involved following the collapse of its buffer stock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said. The ITC's case is being presented by Professor Rosalyn Higgins and is expected to take a further one or two days next week. Court does not sit tomorrow. In essence the Council is claiming that its status is similar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives can therefore not be used in an English court of law. The Council ended its quarterly session today ahead of schedule. The meeting had been expected to go on until tomorrow when the European Community's legal advisers were due to attend, but delegates reviewed the progress of the various legal actions today. Otherwise, the meeting was occupied with internal administrative matters, delegates said. The ITC will continue to operate with a reduced staff after June 30 following the two year extension of the sixth International Tin Agreement. As well as dealing with the ongoing litigation, the Council will continue with its statistical work and carry out some research studies, although staffing in the research department is being cut to one from two previously. At this week's session the Council elected Philip Sparkes of Australia as first vice-chairman for the producing members and Heinz Hofer of Switzerland as second vice-chairman for the consumers for the year from July 1.

LAWSON SAYS LOW U.K. UNIT WAGE COSTS HELP EXPORTS

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said current low unit wage costs are helping British exports but wage rises are "faster than is comfortable." He hoped yesterday's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecasts of increases in wage rises were wrong, saying OECD predictions "are somewhat unreliable." "Productivity is rising very fast, and therefore even though wages are going up faster than is comfortable, the actual unit cost of labour...Is not going up fast at all," Lawson said in answer to questions on BBC radio. "That is one of the reasons why we're doing so well in export markets, for example, but we could do even better and get unemployment down even faster if there was a more moderate rate of growth in wage increases," Lawson added. His remarks followed yesterday's news that underlying average earnings were rising 7.75 pct annually in April, up from March's 7.5 pct increase, which sent the U.K. Government bond market lower and helped trigger inflation worries. Lawson said he would not update his own economic forecasts for the U.K. Until the traditional Autumn Statement on the economy. Lawson would not be drawn on whether he will cut the basic rate of tax from the current 27 pct to 25 pct in the next budget due in March 1988. "We will certainly achieve it sooner or later," he said. The latest official data, released yesterday, showed unit wage costs in manufacturing industry were rising 0.9 pct annually in the three month period ended April, down from a 1.2 pct rise in the first quarter and sharply below last year's first quarter growth rate of 7.8 pct. However, analysts said this figure is likely to deteriorate somewhat as productivity growth slows later this year. REUTER 

U.K. CENTRAL BANK WARNS OF EXCESSIVE RATE CUTS

Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could jeopardise recent economic achievements in the U.K. In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in Birmingham, he said prospective returns on real investment are more favourable, relative to those on financial assets, than for a good number of years. "It would surely be foolish to put that favourable conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or excessively," he said. "We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity, but at the risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of high inflation," he added. Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would argue that interest rates are still too high and deter investment in industry. "But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were intervening to support sterling and had some temporary difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in base rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at the time," he added. Base rate is currently nine pct. REUTER 
FAILURE OF EC FARM PRICE TALKS DISRUPTS TENDERS

There will be no serious bids at European Community open market tenders for wheat and barley until EC farm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package, trade sources said. The failure of farm ministers this week to come to an agreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for export subsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the uncertainty remains. One trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be avoided if an agreemend can be reached soon, but the situation will become more serious as time passes. However, traders said there seem to be few buyers around, lessening the disruptive impact of the delay. Poland and South Korea, who are in the market for feed wheat, will be offered intervention grain through special tenders, traders said. Reuter 
U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES

More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates. And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money. The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business. While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a few years ago. But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders, mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts. As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds. "We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind," said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society, explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only offering variable rate mortgages. The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more. Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for new business, officials at all three institutions said. The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans. "Of course they are less profitable than other (variable rate) mortgages," said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans. But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because, "It was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product." Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year. The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman. "Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage," she said, noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume. In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets. But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money. Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director. Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument. But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably. However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor. For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years. REUTER 
COLD, WET WEATHER SLOWS BEET GROWTH IN W. EUROPE

Cold and wet weather in northern, western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said. Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields. But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth. Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development, Licht said. In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth. In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible. In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was favourable for beet growth, Licht said. In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage. In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union, it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets. In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development. Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where beets are maturing very early this year. Reuter 

PLATINUM DEMAND ESTIMATED 17 PCT HIGHER BY 1991

Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mln ounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln in 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for Johnson Matthey Plc said. Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest single application for platinum. Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces, Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released in London today. Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further increase in investment buying and may well be cautious. He said South Africa was the most likely source of additional supplies and will need to increase output by about 500,000 ounces to meet increased demand. The capital investment required to produce the additional output would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political climate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said. The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the 1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces, Clark said. "The very probability of a growth in demand set against the massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially underpinned in the medium to long-term," Clark said.

CHEVRON N.SEA FIND MAY HOLD 300 MLN BBLS -ANALYSTS

A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron Corp's <CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln barrels, industry analysts said. Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K. Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API crude oil from the tertiary "Alba" sand through a three-inch surface choke. "The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320 mln barrels," Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson and Co told Reuters. He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25 pct. Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be plugged and a sidetrack drilled. "The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs up," Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said. Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well showed that it flows well. "Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low, it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be recovered," Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters. However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not disclose any reserve figures. Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial and developed, there would be a ready local market for the heavy crude it produced. "Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a lot narrower today," Osborne said. Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which include British Petroleum Development Ltd, DSM Hydrocarbons (UK) Ltd, Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd, Marathon Int. Pet.

U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA

An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state, economists said. An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending. "In the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure," noted Peter Spencer, U.K. Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data, which compared won stg August rise, U.K. Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities. Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data, before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone throughout. U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response, resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out. Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "With the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last thing the Bank of England would want to do," Spencer said. "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up," said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury. But "The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign," noted Paul Temperton, U.K. Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct. It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending. Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets. Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour, he said. In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity markets in the past few days, "There will almost certainly be a straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales," Temperton said. "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added. "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very serious panic and a flight to quality," Spencer said. A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending, adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending. Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing. Figures from the Banking Information Service showed personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66 billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments. REUTER 

EC FARM MINISTERS BACK SPENDING CURBS IDEA

European Community (EC) agriculture ministers gave their support in principle for a new scheme to limit spending on the bloc's controversial farm policy at a meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday, Danish minister Laurits Tornaes told journalists. Acceptance of the scheme, by which farmers would suffer price cuts if their production exceeded certain norms, known in EC jargon as stabilisers, is seen by diplomats as vital if the EC is to solve its current massive budget crisis. Speaking at a news conference after chairing a two-day meeting of farm ministers, Tornaes said: "It is no longer a question of whether we are to have stabilisers. It is now a question of how we are to implement them." However, EC sources warned that despite Tornaes' optimism, it may be difficult to get the sort of detailed agreement needed on the stabiliser scheme ahead of an EC heads of government meeting in Copenhagen on December 6. This is the vital meeting at which EC leaders will be asked to agree a new system of EC financing, ending the bloc's hand-to-mouth existence which has resulted in its being unable to agree a budget for 1988. Britain has said it will block moves to give the EC additional sources of finance unless a detailed system of stabilisers is agreed at or ahead of the summit. Under the most important stabiliser scheme, EC guaranteed prices for cereals would be cut by one percentage point for every per cent by which the annual harvest exceeded 155 mln tonnes, a figure well below what EC farmers are capable of producing in a year of favourable weather conditions. Farm ministers will meet again on November 16 to attempt to hammer out an accord, and Danish diplomatic sources said the meeting could last through several long nights of negotiation. But Tornaes said any thought that success was not ultimately possible would be a gesture of retreat at this stage. EC Commission sources said among the remaining problems were appeals from Southern member states for protection for their small and relatively poor farmers, and calls from France and the Netherlands for significant changes to Commission proposals for arable crops. They added that West Germany appears still reluctant to accept the idea of production ceilings being set at the level of the EC as a whole rather than that of member states. Meanwhile, the ministers made little progress in agreeing a scheme to top up the income of poorer farmers through direct payments, which could help to cushion the impact of stabilisers on them. British minister John MacGregor told journalists :"The proposals as they stand have very few friends." He said a number of countries fear they could simply encourage further unwanted production by giving farmers the cash to improve production methods. Reuter 
BRITAIN TAKES STRONG LINE ON EC FARM BUDGET PLAN

British foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told his EC colleagues on Monday that Britain wants agreement by December on a detailed plan to curb EC farm spending if it is to sanction an increase in EC budgetary resources. British diplomatic sources quoted Howe as saying that an accord containing detailed figures and involving immediate penalties for farmers in the case of overproduction must be reached in advance of an EC heads of government summit meeting in December. "We require numbers as well as words in all the commodity regimes," Howe was quoted as saying. The EC Commission proposed last month a plan for "budgetary stabilisers" under which there would be reductions in guaranteed prices, restrictions of sales into intervention or increases in coresponsibility levies if output of individual commodities exceeded certain levels. Britain has so far given the clearest backing to the idea, although several other EC states back it in outline. Diplomats say Britain can exercise some leverage on the issue because the EC is in a severe budgetary crisis from which it can only emerge if all 12 member states agree to revise the system by which it is financed. The sources quoted Howe as saying: "An interim or partial solution covering some elements of the Commission package would be unacceptable to the United Kingdom." They said he insisted that any penalties imposed on farmers for exceeding production limits must take effect in the same marketing year as the overproduction, rather than resulting in a price adjustment the following year. Howe also said there should be no question of a special fund which could top up EC farm coffers in the event of an unexpected development such as a major fall in the value of the dollar. The Commission has suggested such a fund to deal with emergency situations. French EC affairs minister Bernard Bosson told journalists that his country could not accept the idea that there should be no emergency reserve. "The British position has become tougher," he said. Howe was speaking at a meeting of EC foreign ministers, which discussed the future of EC finances, and which took place simultaneously with a farm ministers' meeting to consider the Commission's farm spending proposals. Before his meeting got under way, British agriculture minister John MacGregor said he backed the Commission proposal to set the 1988 cereals production ceiling at 155 mln tonnes. Reuter 
