STANDARD TRUSTCO SEES BETTER YEAR

Standard Trustco said it expects earnings in 1987 to increase at least 15 to 20 pct from the 9,140,000 dlrs, or 2.52 dlrs per share, recorded in 1986. "Stable interest rates and a growing economy are expected to provide favorable conditions for further growth in 1987," president Brian O'Malley told shareholders at the annual meeting. Standard Trustco previously reported assets of 1.28 billion dlrs in 1986, up from 1.10 billion dlrs in 1985. Return on common shareholders' equity was 18.6 pct last year, up from 15 pct in 1985.

HUTCHISON SEES HIGHER PAYOUT, SATISFACTORY PROFITS

Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <HWHH.HK> expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not make any specific projections for the company's earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue. It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year, equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share split. Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper, compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares. Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth. Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct. But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony. He said all of the company's major operations showed improved results in 1986. Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> to <Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric. Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share. Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares. The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish. Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off. He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites. Its major assets are the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel, property development, and interests in Husky Oil Ltd <HYO.TO> of Canada and Pearson Plc <PSON.L> of Britain. REUTER 

CHEUNG KONG CHAIRMAN SEES STRONG RESULTS IN 1987

Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <CKGH.HK> is expecting strong results this year after reporting better than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19 cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a four-for-one stock split. The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15 cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus issue. Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985. Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln dlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> for one billion dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985. Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local property market and substantial increases in contributions from associated companies. "Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for the property market," Li said. "The growth in (Hong Kong's) exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial buildings." Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a second airport.

COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELPED RETURN TO PROFITS

Comalco Ltd <CMAC.S> said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Withdrawal from the <Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the <New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's <Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said. As previously reported Comalco's <Commonwealth Aluminium Corp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at Goldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to <Columbia Aluminium Corp>. Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the provision made in the 1986 accounts. The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5 mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange losses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision. REUTER 
CRA EXPECTS TO PAY FINAL DIVIDEND OF 10 CENTS

CRA Ltd <CRAA.S> said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985. The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln. CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid. The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement. Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said. Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers. Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said. Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said. World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said. Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd <BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd's <CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln. Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said. Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said. Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln. CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985. CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard. Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said. Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs. CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost. REUTER 

ROYAL BANK/CANADA SEES HIGHER 1987 LOAN LOSSES

<Royal Bank of Canada> said it estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr increase over last year. Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and also continued to add to its general provisions for loans to troubled borrower countries. The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the year-ago quarter. The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0 billion dlrs a year ago. In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans associated with the energy sector--continue to have a substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings. Taylor said profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their potential impact on the Royal Bank. The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to 114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago. Reuter 

ROYAL BANK SEES IMPROVED RESULTS

<Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a 19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to report improved results in future earnings periods. "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income, highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement. The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago. Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year. Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago. Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said. The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages. Reuter 

B.C. RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY

<British Columbia Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term. The company said the credit facility is extendable under certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation. It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs. B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended. However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said. Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders, with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31, the company said. If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co <WTC>, B.C. Resources said. The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia. B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and gas interests by 67 pct owned <Westar Mining Ltd>. B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the company said. The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C. Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and exposure to the fluctuating pulp market. It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs. Reuter 
VEREINS- UND WESTBANK TO REORGANIZE NETWORK

und Westbank AG <VHBG.F> plans to streamline its branch network to improve its distribution of financial services, management board member Eberhard-Rainer Luckey said. He told a news conference on 1986 results that branches in Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein would be merged or closed, a branch in Frankfurt opened and that the bank was considering opening a branch in London. Luckey said the bank's total operating profits rose nearly 29 pct in 1986. Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from 42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks. The group balance sheet, including for the first time VereinWest Overseas Finance (Jersey), rose 9.2 pct to 17.9 billion marks, Luckey said. The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2 billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8 billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion while loans to companies rose seven pct. Foreign business and securities trading turnover also increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own account contributed to record operating profits. Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1 mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to 156.7 mln, Luckey said. Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory. The bank's exposure in Latin America was less than two pct of its total foreign credit and in Africa less than one pct. The bank continued to sell some of its exposure in 1986, and will also continue to stock up risk provisions, he said. REUTER 

TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS

French oil group Total Cie Francaise des Petroles <TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986, after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the company said in a communique after a board meeting here. In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs. Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France <RAFF.PA>, told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation. CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985. But its net loss last year, taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985. In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaud said. The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000 this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln francs, he said. Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was a good month, but the situation deteriorated in February." Reuter 

HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE

The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp <HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth, share analysts polled by Reuters said. Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion. They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue. Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year, probably one for three or one for five. The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd <HSGH.HK> is to report its 1986 results on Friday. Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to 12 pct. They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985. Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise, Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct. "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said. Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985. Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985. Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds. The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply. "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks," one analyst said. The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd <WAIA.HK> and <James Capel and Co>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said. Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr flotation of <Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time. The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in <South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs. The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said. Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was much lower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions." Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs. The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, appears to have improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985. REUTER 

CANADIAN IMPERIAL SEES LOWER LOAN LOSSES

<Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>, earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last year's 697.0 mln dlrs. However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of provisioning for loan losses established last year because of many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31. The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5 mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts. Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in calculating first quarter results. The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to 172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal government's Inspector General of Banks. First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs. Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to 213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions, non-interest expenses and income taxes. The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92 billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields. Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100 dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986, but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter. The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4 billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from fiscal 1986 year-end. "Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loans to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987, and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earnings prior to the announcement," Commerce bank said. The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact on future earnings by Brazil's suspension of interest payments. Reuter 

SHELL FRANCAISE RETURNS TO PROFIT IN 1986

Shell Francaise <SFMF.PA>, a subsidiary of <Shell Petroleum NV>, returned to the black last year for the first time since 1982, with parent company net profit of 43 mln francs against losses of 968 mln in 1985 and 1.07 billion in 1984. In 1982 it posted a profit of 329 mln. The company said in a statement that cash flow had improved strongly although it remained negative at 182 mln francs against 1.34 billion in 1985, due largely to improved performances by its main profit centres. It said the results could have been even better had it not been for the collapse of refining and sales profit margins in the last quarter of the year. In 1986 Shell sold 14.74 mln tonnes of oil products against 14.52 mln tonnes in 1985. The company said the results were in line with its targets for the second year of its three-year recovery programme. Meanwhile, <Societe Shell Chimie) said it also returned to profit in 1986, for the first time since 1976, posting net profit of 160 mln francs against a 1985 loss of 57 mln.

"Looking to the longer term, Spar is confident that its continuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-based communications and electro-optical defense systems will lead to significant growth in revenues and earnings over the next five years," the company said. It also forecast higher 1987 sales due to an increased order backlog. Revenues last year fell to 191 mln dlrs from 223.3 mln while profit fell to 4.4 mln dlrs from 13.1 mln. Spar added that lower development costs in the communications group and a return to normal operations in gears and transmissions and aviation services "will remove a serious drain on profits" this year. It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications group losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new products and market development, a four-month strike at its Toronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization from customers to start work on new programs.

Viner earlier reported a fourth quarter loss of 918,000 U.S. dlrs after a 1.5 mln dlr writedown of its stake in Heck's. It earned 585,000 dlrs in the previous fourth quarter.

ABN SAYS PROFIT RISE ENCOURAGING IN VIEW DOLLAR

Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. <ABNN.AS> chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar. Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance, notably in the securities business. He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock. News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders. Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said. Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders, he added. Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities, he said. Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank stocks recently. He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said. He added that losses incurred through loans to tin producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had been written off. REUTER 

CONTINENTAL BANK/CANADA SETS DISTRIBUTION

Continental Bank of Canada, a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank PLC <LLOY.L>, said it intends to redeem all existing preferred shares and distribute a stock dividend to common shareholders. The initial distribution will be in cumulative redeemable retractable floating rate class A preferred shares series II, which will carry a retraction right enabling holders to receive 12.75 dlrs for each share. Continental said the 58.6 mln dlrs of existing outstanding preferred shares will be paid off at par plus accrued dividends. Continental said the notes will carry a dividend rate of 72 pct of prime and it expects that the shares will trade at 12.75 dlrs or more, enabling shareholders who wish to receive cash to do so. The bank said it expects the distribution will be made in early May, subject to various approvals. Continental also said that, as of March 2, it had cash of more than 250 mln dlrs and equity of about 284.6 mln dlrs, allowing for a final total distribution of 16.60 dlrs per common share. Continental Bank said it continues to expect that the final distribution to shareholders will be in the range of 16.50 dlrs to 17.25 dlrs per share and will take place in late 1988 or early 1989. Until the initial stock distribution takes place, regular dividend payments will be maintained on the existing preferred shares, the bank said. The distribution is part of the terms of Continental Bank of Canada's sale of its banking assets to Lloyds Bank Canada, a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank PLC. Continental Bank said Lloyds Bank Canada paid the balance of the purchase price but that it was lower than originally anticipated since Continental was unable to transfer certain income tax deductions to Lloyds Bank. Continental did not give further details. More 
CHARAN SEES AT LEAST 50 PCT RISE IN 1987 PROFIT

(Charan Industries Inc), a distributor of toys and other consumer products, expects 1987 net profit to rise at least 50 pct over last year's 6.1 mln dlrs, president Earl Takefman told reporters before the annual meeting. "We grew basically 100 pct last year, I'm not sure we're going to be able to grow 100 pct again this year but we certainly will grow at least 50 pct over last year," Takefman said. Charan reported profit of 3.0 mln dlrs in 1985. Takefman said he expects sales to rise to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 57.3 mln dlrs in 1986. Fiscal 1985 ended September 30, while fiscal 1986 ended November 30. Takefman said the company is actively looking for acquisitions in the consumer products industry, likely in Canada. The company said it expects to resolve delivery problems this year which last year hindered the growth of its toy distribution business, which accounts for about one-third of revenues. Charan is the exclusive distributor in Canada for <Worlds of Wonder> toys, which include the Teddy Ruxpin voice-activated talking plush bear. Takefman said new products this year, which will be on the shelves for Christmas, include a smaller version of Teddy Ruxpin, a talking Mickey Mouse toy, dancing plush toys, a doll with a voice activated by sound, touch, light and heat, and talking books. The company is also marketing an extended line of "laser tag" kits, which shoot rays of light and tell you when you've hit someone. Other products include a recorder device which allows students to leave taped messages in each others' school lockers, retailing for about 60 dlrs. Reuter 
CANADIAN PACIFIC LTD 4TH QTR OPER NET 30 CTS VS 20 CTS



CANADIAN PACIFIC (CP) CONFIRMS EARNINGS

Canadian Pacific Ltd said fourth quarter 1986 operating profit rose to 91.6 mln dlrs, or 30 cts a share, from 50.7 mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, a year ago. The statement confirmed released preliminary earnings figures the company released in February. A 102.6 mln dlr gain on the sale of CP's Cominco Ltd interest helped raise final 1986 fourth quarter profit to 193.8 mln dlrs or 65 cts a share. The company said a drop in 1986 full-year operating profit to 150.1 mln dlrs from a restated 252.7 mln dlrs in 1985 was due mainly to lower world oil prices. The company said its CP Rail division reported 1986 net income of 119.4 mln dlrs, compared with 133.4 mln dlrs in 1985. It said grain traffic recovered from drought-affected levels of a year ago but was offset by weakness in other traffic areas and increased expenses. It said the net loss from its Soo Line increased to 33.5 mln dlrs loss from 8.7 mln dlrs loss in 1985, mainly due to restructuring charges. Canadian Pacific said favorable developments during the year included reduced bulk shipping losses as a result of a recovery in tanker markets and a turnaround in the forest products sector. Reuter 

Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corp Ltd said it expects 1987 earnings will be lower than last year's previously reported 85 cts a share. But profits "will be at a satisfactory level," the company said in the annual report without giving a specific estimate. Highveld said it expects appreciation of the rand will be offset to some extent by increasing U.S. Dollar prices for its exports as the year progresses. Highveld said measures taken last year by the European Economic Community and the United States prohibiting all South African steel products "presents a challenge to management to place the steel in other areas." The company said overall world vanadium consumption in 1987 is expected to be similar to last year although China's role is still an unknown factor in the total supply-demand situation.

PREUSSAG SAYS PAYMENT OF A 1986 DIVIDEND NOT CERTAIN

A spokesman for Preussag AG <PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985. Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board. The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group's other divisions. The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions. Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before. The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before. Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln. The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector. The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results. Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year. Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG. Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison figures. Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0 pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes. Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC) subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year. AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world group losses that year. REUTER 
CREDITANSTALT SEES HIGHER 1987 DIVIDEND

Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> is likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12 pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido Schmidt-Chiari said. The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986 from 2.7 billion a year earlier. Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985. Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast. The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion. General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year's better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending. Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries, he said. Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits, Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure. Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations, removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total. In an attempt to generate more foreign business, representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends. Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors. Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in 1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of 2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and large Austrian companies. But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr -Daimler-Puch AG <SDPV.VI> would return a 1987 result similar to the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings. REUTER 

Operating profit rose to just under 120 mln marks in 1986, from around 100 mln in 1985. However, the group's third party sales fell sharply to 7.2 billion marks from 9.4 billion the year before, largely due to lower prices for energy products, particularly oil and coal, managing board chairman Klaus Giesel told a news conference.

OUTOKUMPU RESTRUCTURES COPPER DIVISION

Finland's mining and metals group Outokumpu Oy <OUTO.HE>, which last week reported a 1986 loss of 83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt to rationalize production and improve profitability. Outokumpu's Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a news conference the reorganization involved a split of the division into a new independent division with six profit centres. Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982. Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in January 1986, <Metallverken Ab> and <Wirsbo Bruks Ab>, that were merged into its copper processing division. The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last year, 42 pct of Outokumpu's group turnover of 7.58 billion. The new Outokumpu division, called Copper Products Industry, is to incorporate Outokumpu's copper production plants, including its two U.S. Subsidiaries <Nippert Co> and <Valleycast Inc>, as well as Metallverken and part of Wirsbo. Outokumpu is planning to make Wirsbo an independent division in the Outokumpu group and transfer only Wirsbo's copper tube production into one of the new division's profit centres. A definite decision on Wirsbo will be taken later this year. The new division will have production plants in Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and the U.S. REUTER 

Earnings per 20-crown share went from 23.79 crowns to 20.45 crowns but the company proposed an unchanged 20 pct dividend. "Foreign exchange fluctuations in 1986 were a very significant factor behind developments in the result before and after tax," Novo said in a statement. "Not only the U.S. Dollar but also other currencies essential to Novo fell in 1986 in relation to the Danish crown," the statement added. In November 1986, Novo purchased 75 pct of shares in A/S Ferrosan, which heads a group specialising in research and development of CNS (central nervous treatment) treatments and the sale of pharmaceuticals and vitamins in Scandinavia.

SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD

Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non- performing loans. Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a little this year. But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will remain vulnerable. One senior bank credit officer said "The work is largely done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions, but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money." The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in 1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad decline. The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world oil prices tumbled. Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at the expense of increased provisions. The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, <United Saudi Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln riyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln. Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to 60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985. Other results released so far show <Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7 mln riyals, while <Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals. Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's <CCI.N> Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez, increased provisions sharply. <Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1 mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln riyals. Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non- performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the Saudi economy bottoms out. Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic activity, but one banker said "The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks are now at or close to international levels on provisions." From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank <National Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the private sector, bankers calculated. Between 1982 and 1985, <Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine. Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for declaring loans as non-performing. Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in force in major world financial centres. Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank as the strongest earners. Other banks such as <Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by the <British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a relatively low deposit base. Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most conservative in making provisions. Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a Saudi bank go under and not only supported <Saudi Cairo Bank> after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made available cheap deposits to <Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB. The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans. And while banks in more liberal financial markets can attempt to diversify away from traditional lending, conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate fee income from new investment banking products. One banker said "Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not good." Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return on their money. In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer funds are held on current account. REUTER 
BOLIDEN SAYS RESULTS BURDENED BY LOSS WRITEOFF

Swedish mining and metals group Boliden AB <BLDS ST> forecast a return to profitability during 1987 after recording a 1.08 billion crown 1986 loss burdened by a massive write-off. The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and investment conglomerate <Ahlsell AB> this year, said the result included restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns. "These costs have arisen as a results of a change of direction for the group. They are mainly one-off but they have burdened the annual accounts," the company said in a statement. Boliden said the company's liquid assets were 1.36 billion crowns at year-end which together with an investment portfolio of 1.60 billion made it one of the most liquid Swedish companies. As a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposed cancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a return to profitability during 1987, the statement added. Swedish tyres, process equipment and components firm <Trelleborg AB> has taken a majority stake in Boliden since the beginning of this year. Trelleborg then said it had no plans for consolidating Boliden. REUTER 

LYONNAISE DES EAUX FORECASTS 1987 PROFIT RISE

Consolidated attributable net profit of Ste Lyonnaise des Eaux <LYOE.PA> is likely to rise by at least 10 pct this year from the 360 mln francs reported for 1986, Chairman Jerome Monod told a news conference. Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7 mln reported for this year, while group investments should total around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billion annual average of the past three years, he added. Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group's leisure industry, health and communications activities, Monod said. In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development with Club Mediterranee <CMI.PA>, Club Med, of a 200 hectare pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern Central France, he said. Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med as operator of the complex, he said. He gave no financial details but said leisure sector investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next three years. Investments in the communications industry would go mainly to develop the group's cable television activities and its 25 pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in France. Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux would provide about 175 mln, Monod said. Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television advertising market. Total investment by the group in the communications sector, including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400 mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the coming year. Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln and 200 mln over the five years, with the aim of widening the audience to 280,000 subscribers from 12,000, and boosting turnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln.

JACOBS SUCHARD EXPECTS ANOTHER EXCELLENT YEAR

Jacobs Suchard AG <JACZ.Z> hopes for another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986 net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said. The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs. Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the company's target of five pct real annual growth, had been made possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986 which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year. Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24 billion francs was due to currency factors. A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset by growth in operations and by structural changes within the group. Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany. Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25 pct against 25.3 pct. Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further increase in tax levels was expected in future. Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln the previous year. REUTER 

SAND TECHNOLOGY <SNDCF> MULLING REVERSE SPLIT

Sand Technology Systems Inc said it is considering a reverse stock split of at least one-for-10 and expects to report a second-quarter profit, compared to a loss last year. The stock consolidation "is something we're discussing, but it's not definite," Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner told Reuters in an interview. A private placement recently brought the number of outstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July 31, 1986, the fiscal yearend. "The company has always had the aura of a penny stock," Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to apply for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange. Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of five pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs, for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the third quarter should be about the same as the second, he added. Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195 dlrs in the second quarter. After "a disastrous first quarter," Sand hopes to break even in the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company has scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the 33.5 mln dlrs projected in December. The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and Canadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs, or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs. In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost 1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585 dlrs. Shattner believes the company will post better results this year due to several factors. "Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buying products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the second quarter," he said. Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computer accessories such as disk drives, solid-state memory enhancement devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd <HIT> of Japan. Shattner said Sand's affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc, is developing software that lets large maniframe computers handle large databases and share them between applications. It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, which is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major corporations. The company has also reduced costs through some staff cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff instead of straight commissions, Shattner said. And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourth fiscal quarter, Shattner said. Reuter 

Financial and industrial holding company Nord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of 400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said. He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receive approval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two week, when terms would set according to market conditions. He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new investments. Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25 francs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985. Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against 147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.

Adsteam said it expects to maintain an annual dividend rate of 36 cents on capital enlarged to about 149 mln shares by both issues from 99.36 mln. Adsteam said its diverse industrial interests generally performed well and its results, as the ultimate holding company and beneficiary, reflected this solid performance. David Jones, owned 49.2 pct by Adsteam, earned the largest associates' net of 57.38 mln dlrs in the half against 40.29 mln a year earlier, Adsteam's figures show. Wholly-owned and joint venture companies also did well apart from timber, building supplies and real estate, which returned below-budget profits due to the housing downturn. Adsteam said it sees 1987/88 as a year of reconstruction and consolidation with the capital base boosted by the issue. REUTER 

SCHWEIZERHALLE FIRE HIT SANDOZ 1986 PROFITS

Sandoz AG <SANZ.Z> would have reported a percentage rise in net profits "close to double figures" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for November's warehouse fire, a senior company official said. The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which caused severe pollution of the Rhine. Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share. This year began well, with the performance in January and February at least equal to the same period last year, the official said. The company is expected to give fuller details of its results at a news conference on April 22. Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover any liability arising from the accident. The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the "one pct" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution from the fire. Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the Rhine since the accident. However, the official said the final figure would be "much less than that cited in earlier comments." He gave no further details. In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy <CIGZ.Z>, which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also hit by the falling dollar, the official said. Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to 8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said. Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs. The third major Swiss chemical company, F.

ALUSUISSE SEES POSSIBLE BREAK-EVEN IN 1987

Schweizerische Aluminimum AG <ALUZ.Z> (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said. "The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future," he said. "We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that our industrial environment does not worsen." He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses. Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985. Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion. Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985. But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset. Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from 472 mln in 1985. It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining, after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985. Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from 1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22. Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this "radical elimination of the mortgages of the past" painful, but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy. Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion. Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985. In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland <SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp <SBVZ.Z> and Credit Suisse <CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan. The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987. Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts. That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln. The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar alternations were made for previous years. After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895 mln francs. REUTER 

ALUSUISSE PLANS 50 PCT CAPITAL CUT

Schweizerische Aluminium AG, Alusuisse, plans to reduce share and participation certificate capital by 50 pct to cover losses in 1986 and those carried forward from the previous year, chief executive Hans Jucker said. Jucker told a news conference that the greatest drain on its financial resources had been stopped, but after extraordinary charges the net loss of 688 mln francs in 1986 was only slightly under the 756 mln loss of the previous year. The losses in 1986 and those carried over from 1985 made it necessary to reduce capital by 50 pct, he said. However, Jucker said the company improved liquidity through a recovery in cash flow and conversion of 300 mln Swiss francs of credit into a subordinated loan. Trading in Alusuisse shares was suspended on the Zurich stock exchange after today's announcement by the company that it would cut its share capital by 50 pct, the bourse said. Trading would resume again on Monday. Reuter 

CITROEN EXPECTS HIGHER PROFITS, HELPED BY AX

Automobiles Citroen expects rising sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits significantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after six straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said. Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX sports model, he said: "All the budgetary forecasts that we have been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement in 1987, compared with 1986," he added. Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA <PEUP.PA> group, increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after 11.7 pct in 1986. The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from 2.9 pct in 1986. "Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the demand," Calvet said. "This is a relatively new problem for us." Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise its range and improve productivity. Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986 profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs. This weekend he said that those profit estimates "remain about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic." Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be available throughout most of western Europe within four months. The car has registered just over 20,000 sales. It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous- Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of 1,000 cars a day. The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa. The AX had built up its market share in France to around four pct last month. Calvet said: "Our hope is that once the AX is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent of the national market." REUTER 

ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION

<Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move unique among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said. First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is attainable. But it "will be a tremendous achievement because ... they're going to have to build an international earnings base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic trust companies," Walsh said. Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's 154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview. He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26 pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990. Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank. Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking. The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980, Cornelissen said. Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical Co <DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset management, merchant and private banking companies. "It was a heaven-sent opportunity," Cornelissen said of the Dow Financial acquisition. "We achieved in one year what would otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up." Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct competition with major global financial institutions in activities such as international lending and stock brokerage, in order to exploit "profitable niches" overseas in traditional trust activities such as asset management, private banking and advisory services. He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations "before the end of this month" to sell its London-based Savory Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal. "The international market is so big and we have such a miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really limited only by our energy and our desire to find more business," he said, adding that in trust-type services, "we don't think the international markets are well-served." Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign investment interest in North America and increased Canadian investment abroad, Cornelissen said. Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust. Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, "We knew we had to be there." Royal Trust's 14 international locations include offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any acquisitions in the "immediate future," although "we have our eyes wide open for the right opportunities." Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units, Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well covered by hundreds of small regional banks. "That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.," said Cornelissen. "That is probably one area that we will probably do something with in the next five years." He said the company would continue to emphasize its home Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust. Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks, trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition for Royal Trust, "but not drastically more," Cornelissen said.

ROYAL BANK/CANADA BRAZIL UNIT SEES GROWTH

Royal Bank of Canada's <RY> small Brazilian commercial bank subsidiary Banco Royal do Canada (Brasil) S.A. sees opportunities for its own growth with an expected substantial increase in Brazilian exports to Canada, Banco Royal president Michael Brennan said. "They (Brazilian exporters) are very interested in the Canadian market because it's an untapped market," Brennan told reporters after a speech to the Brazil/Canada Chamber of Commerce. Brennan said Brazil is currently exporting products like paper machinery and ships to Canada. He said he hopes to see medium-term financing facilities for Brazilian companies reinstated shortly, following an agreement reached in January with international financial authorities. Brennan estimated Brazilian exports to Canada totalled roughly 800 mln Canadian dlrs in 1985 while imports from Canada reached about 700 mln dlrs. Brennan said he expects Banco Royal profit to increase this year from the three mln U.S. dlrs reported for fiscal 1986 ended September 30 but said he could not predict by how much because of the country's uncertain financial climate. Brennan said he expects his bank's growth to come from increased exports to Canada. Banco Royal is the only Canadian-owned commercial bank in Brazil although <Bank of Montreal> has a Brazilian investment bank subsidiary, he said. Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach an equitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign debt, because the Brazilian economy is essentially healthy. He said he believed Brazil might be in a position to resume debt repayments within a year. Brennan said he could not comment on the impact of Brazil's interest payment moratorium on the Royal Bank of Canada. Reuter 

CATHAY PACIFIC 1986 PROFIT SEEN ABOVE TARGET

Buoyed by low fuel prices and favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's <CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said. Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports results tomorrow for its first year as a public company. Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, made its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in May last year. Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the prospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said. They said the airline's performance improved in the second half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln dlrs. The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company's favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said. James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the 1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would affect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits of 1.25 billion dlrs. Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative. "This is reflected in their interim results which showed that profit margin has increased," said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier levels, but profits rose 69 pct. The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on the company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices usually lag behind crude price movements by several months, analysts said. By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and sterling 12 pct. "Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against Cathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields in the first half up 7.2 pct," said James Capel. "This should continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to end the year up 7.6 pct." A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash under management also improved profits, James Capel said. A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed to Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factor declined because of increased competition and an expansion of its fleet and services. James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown climbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fell to 68.8 pct from 70 pct. "Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air," said Tsang. "This affected its load factor." Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier <Hong Kong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay's decision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts said. REUTER 

State-owned <Chemie Linz AG> is likely to record a 1986 loss of some 600 mln schillings compared with a 340 mln loss in 1985, a company spokesman said. Falling sales and lower world prices of fertilisers were largely responsible for the sharp increase, along with the effects of the dollar's fall which has helped to give U.S. Fibre producers a competitive edge, he told Reuters. The firm would have made a small profit in 1985 had it not been for 456 mln schillings lost by subsidiary <Merx HandelsgesmbH> on oil trading. Merx has since withdrawn from the oil market.

GENSTAR SALE BOOSTS BELGIAN SOCIETE GENERALE NET

Societe Generale de Belgique <BELB.BR> said the near doubling of net profits in 1986 was due in large part to the sale of shares in Genstar Corp.

However, it added in a statement that the company made major capital gains on sales during the year, in particular from the sale of Genstar shares. Societe Generale governor Rene Lamy told last November's annual meeting that 1986 asset disposals would total around 4.5 billion francs, including the sale of Genstar shares to Imasco Limited <IMS.TO>.

CATHAY PACIFIC FORECASTS GOOD 1987 PERFORMANCE

Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HK> forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over the year-earlier period. The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987 but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co <BA.N> 747 freighter and one Boeing 747-300 passenger plane in September and November respectively after it took a 747-300 last month. It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit to 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14 cents a share. But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance charges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year. A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft deliveries in 1986. However, the company said in a statement good returns from funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and other borrowing. It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel prices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in 1985. Passengers carried by Cathay Pacific totalled 4.2 mln last year, up from 3.85 in 1985, with the passengers kilometre travelled rising to 14.02 billion from 12.56 billion. But passenger load factor was down to 69.1 pct from 71.0 pct. The airline's cargo operations recorded growth of 21 pct in total tonnage over the previous year and a 35.9 pct rise in revenue to 1.79 billion dlrs. Cathay Pacific floated its shares in April, 1986 and is now 50.23 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HK>, 16.43 pct by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp <HKBH.HK> and 12.5 pct by <China International Trust and Investment Corp>.

VW'S AUDI SAYS PROFIT FELL AROUND 50 PCT IN 1986

Audi AG <NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record 221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous year. Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels. He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985's record levels. Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from 9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year. Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits. Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend. Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About alleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models. As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59,800 last year. Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987. Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000. Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000, but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180 in 1985. Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57,000. Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen compared with 1985's 392,000. Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to further new hiring of employees. At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record 39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985. REUTER 

DEUTSCHE BABCOCK TO INCREASE DIVIDEND IN 1986/87

Deutsche Babcock AG <DBCG.F> will increase its dividend on results in the year ending September 30, 1987, chief executive Helmut Wiehn said. Wiehn told a news conference Deutsche Babcock would double the absolute amount it distributes to shareholders. This overall increase would also be due partly to an increase of nominal share capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks. A higher dividend had been anticipated because Deutsche Babcock has said in the past that it will only raise capital when it can make a lasting improvement in the dividend. Reuter 

LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87

Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard Wagner said. Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling interest rates. The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividend to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985. Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: "We will endeavour to maintain the higher dividend in 1987." Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7 billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985. Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total. Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said that it came close to one mln stg. On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed 8.7 pct to 738.9 mln. According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct. Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state. Reuter 
LAURENTIAN GROUP SEES HIGHER SHARE NET

<Laurentian Group Corp> said it expects 1987 earnings per share will show about the same proportionate increase as in 1986. Last year, the company had 25.7 mln dlrs operating profit, or 76 cts per share, up from 11.1 mln dlrs, or 59 cts per share, in 1985. Shares outstanding increased to 39 mln from 27.8 mln. The American holding company, Laurentian Capital Corp, will show a substantial improvement this year, chairman Claude Castonguay said before the annual meeting. Laurentian Capital Corp, which recently acquired two small U.S. life insurance companies, had 1986 profit of 1.1 mln U.S. dlrs, or eight cts per share, compared to seven mln U.S. dlrs, or 68 cts per share. Castonguay said Laurentian Group Corp, the parent firm, plans to fill out its national financial services distribution system and make further acquisitions if the right opportunity occurs. The company also may expand this year in continental Europe, in conjunction with La Victoire, a French insurance company, he said. Reuter 

FAIRFAX SAYS HIGHER TAX HITS FIRST HALF EARNINGS

Media group John Fairfax Ltd <FFXA.S> said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the impact of changes in the Australian tax system. Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to 25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln a year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30 mln from 44.29 mln. Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the company said in a statement. Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue growth in the television industry as another reason for the flat first half earnings. It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of these factors. Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly. But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0 pct rise in revenue, it said. Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from <Australian Associated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's "B" shares in Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L>. This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit. Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr acquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.

SWISSAIR REPORTS LOWER PROFIT AND DIVIDEND

Swissair <SWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pct drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that, in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut its payout to 33 francs per share from 38. President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate. The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year, he said. The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s. Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation. Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation. Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc. While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies. "Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin," he said. "Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines."

PORSCHE HALF-YEAR EARNINGS CALLED SATISFACTORY

Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG <PSHG.F> said earnings in first half year 1986/87 were "satisfactory" despite burdens caused by the dollar's weakness against the mark and stagnating domestic demand. In its semi-annual shareholders' report, Porsche said first half turnover fell six pct to 1.71 billion marks from 1.83 billion in the same period of 1985/86. However, earnings were satisfactory, it said, without giving absolute figures. Domestic turnover fell 26 pct to 283 mln marks from 380 mln. Foreign turnover dipped to 1.43 billion marks from 1.45 billion in the first half of last year, although the export quota rose to 83 pct from 79 pct. The car sector accounted for 1.51 billion marks of turnover, against 1.63 billion the year earlier, it said. Production dropped five pct to 25,876 cars from 27,381. Manufacture of the 911 and 928 models rose six pct to 11,122 from 10,533 units but production of 924 and 944 models was cut by 12 pct to 14,754 units from 16,848 and would be cut further, the report said. Car sales fell four pct to 25.269 units from 26,414 in the comparable half year, the report said. U.S. Demand continued for all models but demand fell in other markets. Domestic sales were 39 pct down at 3,267 units from 5,397, while sales abroad rose five pct to 22,002 from 21,017. Share of exports in sales rose to 87 pct from 80 pct. Investments were reduced to 108 mln marks from 125 mln. Earnings were hit by lower sales and by the lower value of the dollar and currencies in other important markets. Nevertheless, sales and turnover would finish the July 11 year at a "high level," Porsche said. REUTER 

DEUTSCHE BABCOCK SEES HIGHER 1986/87 PROFITS

Deutsche Babcock AG <DBCG.F> expects profits to rise in the current financial year ending September 9 although the earnings level is still unsatisfactory, managing board chairman Helmut Wiehn said. He told a news conference that business during the year had weakened somewhat but was still generally positive. Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26 billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period. However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximately unchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks when current orders from major projects are booked. Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end- February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks. Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at 8.64 billion marks. Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct yield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profits totalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against the previous year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks. Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks. Wiehn said Babcock's liquidity had clearly improved in the current business year, with financial reserves in the first five months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing by 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985/86. He said pre-tax earnings per share for 1985/86, according to the DVFA method, were 26.95 marks from 21.40 marks and earnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8.10. The company earlier said dividend will be unchanged at three marks for ordinary shares and 3.50 marks for preference shares. REUTER 

QUEBEC CAISSE EARNS THREE BILLION DLRS IN 1986

Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, the government agency which manages the province's pension funds, said its investment portfolio earned a net profit of almost three billion Canadian dlrs in 1986, an increase of 300 mln dlrs over 1985. The agency said in its annual statement that it had assets with a total book value of 25 billion dlrs, or a market value of 28 billion dlrs, at the end of 1986. These holdings had a rate of return of 13.5 pct in the year, which was below the Caisse's average return of 16 pct in the past four years and 14.2 pct in the past eight years. The Caisse said foreign equity investments represented 3.6 pct of total assets, while U.S. government securities accounted for another 5.2 pct of the overall portfolio. The agency's holding of U.S. government securities yielded a return of 20.7 pct for the year, significantly more than either the 14.1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the 13.5 pct for all funds under management. "These high liquidity securities, which are held on a temporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protection of the overall bond portfolio, have been efficient," the agency said of the U.S. securities. The agency said it has 7.9 billion dlrs invested in Canadian private sector businesses after channeling 965 mln dlrs of new funds into this area in 1986. The Caisse said it acquired 825 mln of new Government of Quebec bonds and 342 mln dlrs of new securities from other Quebec government issuers during the year. Reuter 

SEA CONTAINERS <SCR> EXPECTS BETTER FIRST QTR

Sea Containers Ltd predicted its first quarter fiscal 1987 net earnings would improve by 10 mln dlrs over the same period a year ago. The company said 1987 got off on a much better footing than fiscal 1986, from which the company recorded a loss of 67.6 mln dlrs, or 6.28 dlrs per share, on revenues of 641.4 mln dlrs. James Sherwood, president of the company, said he expects to record a loss of approximately 12 mln dlrs for the first quarter, compared to losses of approximately 22 mln dlrs for first quarter fiscal 1986. The company emphasized the first quarter is a traditionally slow period for the ferry industry, which is part of Sea Containers' business. Sherwoood said the company's losses were largely attributable to non-recurring events and provisions. He cited the default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers, costing the company approximately 25 mln dlrs. He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing two of its subsidiary's ferry services, and a 10.3 mln dlr provision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and severance pay costs.

STANDARD BANK UNABLE TO MAKE EARNINGS FORECAST

Standard Bank Investment Corp Ltd (SPRJ.J) chairman Henri de Villiers said he could not predict profits for the bank this year because of South Africa's continuing political unrest. De Villiers also warned in the annual report that "failing prompt and decisive political action, South Africa faces a future of violent deadlock between different racial and political groupings." He said South Africa's future economic prospects are "clouded by political and social issues and in the absence of evidence that these are being positively addressed I am unable to offer an earnings forecast for 1987." Standard Bank, 39 pct owned by Standard Chartered PLC <STCH.L>, London, previously reported that 1986 net income rose by 13.8 pct to 209.0 mln rand. The bank said its bad debt losses should begin to decline this year "although it may take some time before they return to accepted industry norms." The annual report showed that the bank's charge for bad and doubtful debts rose in 1986 to 187.6 mln rand from 162.1 mln rand in the prior year. The bank said net income of its Standard Bank of South Africa subsidiary declined 8.2 pct in 1986 to 112.3 mln rand in a difficult banking environment caused mainly by low credit demand. REUTER 
BERLINER BANK SUFFERS LOSSES ON STUTTGART LOANS

<Berliner Bank AG> has suffered losses of between 10 and 100 mln marks through credits granted by its Stuttgart branch by officials there exceeding their powers, a bank spokesman said in answer to queries. The spokesman declined to say exactly how large the losses were. Berliner Bank has suspended the three managers of its Stuttgart branch and is continuing an investigation into the case, in which state prosecutors are also participating. The fact that powers had been exceeded emerged in a routine check at the branch. The City of West Berlin owns 74 pct of Berliner Bank and the rest is held by small shareholders. REUTER 

ALLIED-LYONS SEES HIRAM WALKER PROFITS RISING

<Allied-Lyons PLC> sees rising profits from 51-pct-owned liquor producer Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts in the current fiscal year ending in early March, 1988, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in a speech prepared for delivery to Toronto analysts. "We anticipate that Hiram Walker profits will be well above those of the plateau years," he said, referring to the four years up to 1985. "In other words, we will have regained the 1985 position and improved on it," Holden-Brown said. Allied-Lyons won control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham last year in a battle against Gulf Canada Corp, which finally got a 49 pct stake after an out-of-court settlement. Hiram Walker Resources Ltd, the previous owner, reported liquor profits of 282 mln Canadian dlrs in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1985, 278 mln dlrs in 1984, 267 mln in 1983, 294 mln in 1982 and 280 mln in 1981. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' financial results for the fiscal year just ended March seven would include three months of Hiram Walker-Gooderham profits, but he did not provide actual figures. He said Hiram Walker-Gooderham's profit improvement in the current year will come from a previously announced reorganization put into effect March 1, 1987 and a close partnership with Allied-Lyons' existing Allied Vintners division.

ALLIED-LYONS SEES SUBSTANTIAL SECOND HALF GROWTH

<Allied-Lyons PLC> will report substantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 ended March 7, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in answer to reporters' queries. "You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyons in the second half," Holden-Brown said following a presentation to Toronto securities analysts. Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year. Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs associated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the company, Holden-Brown also said. But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said. "So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But hopefully you win them all in the end," Holden-Brown said. Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: "No, I don't." "We must never be complacent and we must always be very watchful, but I think we would be very expensive," he said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporate earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies in the food and beverage industry. "That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I think," Holden-Brown said. Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders take-over bid for the company was "100 pct a growth action." "We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was) defensive, but it never was," Holden-Brown told reporters. Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram Walker, Holden-Brown responded: "Plan might be too strong a word. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to be better known in Canada." Reuter 

ALITALIA REPORTS HIGHER NET PROFITS

Italy's national airline, Alitalia Spa <AZPI.MI>, reporting a 14.6 pct rise in provisional 1986 net profit, said it carried seven pct more passengers on domestic routes last year, but 11.5 pct fewer passengers on flights from North America and Canada. Alitalia said the drop in North American traffic had been due to a general fall in the numbers of American tourists visiting Europe caused by fears of terrorism. The airline reported provisional net profit rose to 55 billion lire from 48 billion in 1985. A spokesman said Alitalia was hoping for an increase in traffic with the U.S. In 1987. It planned to increase the number of flights from Italy to New York to 19 per week, to reinstate flights to Boston and to re-open the direct Rome-Milan-Los Angeles service. The spokesman announced that from March 29, Alitalia would be starting a new weekly service to Shanghai. For its summer 1987 programme, it would be adding 127 extra flights to European destinations -- an increase of 27 pct. REUTER 
RAFIDAIN BANK'S JORDAN BRANCH RAISES CAPITAL

The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Bank said it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country's minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits from its operations in the country. Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to comply with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln dinars -- by the start of 1986. Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi told Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The bank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars. Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided instead to close its operation, banking sources said. Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash. Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an exception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply. They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties. The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to 550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars. REUTER 

AUSTRALIA'S WOOLWORTHS LOOKS TO IMPROVED PROFITS

Woolworths Ltd <WLWA.S> said policy, management and financial changes initiated during the 1986/87 business year should cause profits to reach more acceptable levels in 1987/88 end-February 1. Net profit reported earlier fell 85.3 pct in the year ended February 1. Results for the first month of the new year were encouraging after a period of uncertain consumer confidence and difficult trading conditions, it said in a statement. The Big W discount store division and New South Wales supermarkets produced very disappointing results, it added. Woolworths earlier reported a fall in net profit to 9.27 mln from 63.20 mln on sales of 5.47 billion against 4.83 billion. Capital spending for the year was 119 mln dlrs against 105 mln for the previous year with 50 new stores opened, but total sales were below target, Woolworths said. The company provided 20 mln dlrs against operating profit for the year to cover mark-downs on stock. Extraordinary items included a 53 mln dlr profit on the sale of properties and investments less a 28 mln provision for reorganising the Big W chain. Woolworths is unrelated to the U.S. Group F.W. Woolworth <Z.N>. It has been the subject of takeover speculation since <Industrial Equity Ltd> acquired a 20 pct stake last year. New Zealand's diversified investment group <Rainbow Corp Ltd> bought Safeway Stores Inc's <SA> 20 pct holding in Woolworths for 190 mln dlrs late last year.

BAYERNVEREIN EXPECTS UNCHANGED DIVIDEND FOR 1987

Bayerische Vereinsbank AG <BVMG.F> expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987 earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said. He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986. Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from 222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln. Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0.7 pct. Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986. Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks. The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks. The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5 billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said. It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business. The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45. Hackl said that in January and February this year, the bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

SOCIETE GENERALE REPORTS HIGHER 1986 PROFITS

France's Societe Generale <SGEN.PA> bank, which will be sold to the private sector in the second half of this year, reported increased profits for last year. Societe Generale, one of the three largest state-owned banking groups, said in a statement that its parent company profit for 1986 totalled 800 mln francs, up 21.2 pct on 1985's 660 mln profit. This was in line with earlier forecasts of profit of between 770 and 800 mln francs. The bank's parent company gross operating profits were up 5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985. The increase in the bank's gross operating profits was mostly due to a rise in french franc deposits and personal loans as well as the development of its financial activities, Societe Generale said. Parent company net banking earnings last year were also up at 13.9 billion francs compared with 13.57 billion in 1985 while operating costs totalled 7.44 billion francs against 6.67 billion the previous year. Societe Generale President Marc Vienot said in December he expected group 1986 consolidated profits to rise to between 2.5 billion and 2.6 billion francs from 1.62 billion in 1985. Reuter 

SWIRE SEEN REPORTING 20 PCT RISE IN 1986 PROFIT

Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> is likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said. Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits from operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs compared with 1.23 billion in 1985. They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG> unit last May. Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985. Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its "A" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985. Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits, analysts said. The company's aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in <Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay. Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic. Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50.23 pct. Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs. Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd, estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs. "Much depends on properties," said Measor. "And they did a lot better in the second half of the year." Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985. Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm's properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects. Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second-half 1986. During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates, analysts said. "At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year ago," said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year. The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development, which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James Capel (Far East) Ltd. Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expected to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10 mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

SHELL AUSTRALIA REPORTS 45.79 MLN DLR 1986 PROFIT

Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AMS> unit <Shell Australia Ltd>, said its net profit fell to 45.79 mln dlrs in 1986 from 66.76 mln in 1985. Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion, in an extremely competitive and over-regulated environment, chairman and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25 mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a very disappointing year. "A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct," he said. Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on downstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns and the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project. Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation. "It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy, technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production," he said. "The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way," he said. Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to upgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but further investment required an appropriate rate of return, he said. Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77 mln dlrs from 26.35 mln, while investment in property and plant rose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier.

SANTOS SAYS PROFITS HIT BY OIL PRICE FALL

Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer, Santos Ltd <STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985. Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate. Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier. It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54. Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company <TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs. Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments. Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year. Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct. Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism. But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme. "It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly," Massy-Green said.

VOLVO GROUP COMPANY PROPOSES TWO-FOR-FIVE ISSUE

<AB Catena>, in which AB Volvo <VOLV.ST> has a 48 pct stake, said it was proposing a two-for-five stock issue that will raise the company's equity capital to 420 mln crowns from 300 mln. Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985, despite an increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in 1985. The company said that its 1986 performance was best reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln from 221 mln in 1985. Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a trading and industrial company. In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB. This yielded a profit of 386.7 mln crowns and was reflected in Catena's pre-tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in 1985. REUTER 

PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986

The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said. Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last year's 13.3 billion. Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said "had a very serious impact on Venezuela." PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products. The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year. The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining and marketing operations. Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However, Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd. Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of Venezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said. Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the world, Hernandez said. Reuter 
IMPERIAL OIL <IMO.A> TO FOCUS ON HIGHER PROFIT

Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strength and improving near-term earnings performance through operating expense reductions and selective capital spending, the company said in the annual report. Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648 mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985. Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27 dlrs share in the prior year. Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should the investment climate improve and the belief that low or volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next several years. The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show benefits in 1987. During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of workers by 16 pct to 12,500. Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward movement in international oil prices will be sustained. "It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the company's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals of market supply and demand," he said. Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum products division are more promising than before, but are still uncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985. Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in the United States. The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as long as economic growth continues, but future large grain surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure on prices. Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986, compared to three mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter 

JARDINE MATHESON PROFITS SEEN UP SHARPLY IN 1986

A strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd <JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in 1986, stock analysts said. They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985. The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985. James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales. Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow. Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985. But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35 pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG> will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985. The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong Kong Land of <Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September. Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business, which will increase its overall retail income figures. Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct share of <Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985. Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs. But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said. Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests. It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created <Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest. A company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand. Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is likely to develop its own business, analysts said. "The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions," said Hargreaves of Hoare Govett. He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its existing business. REUTER 
CHINA'S FIRST JOINT VENTURE BANK REPORTS PROFIT

China's first joint venture bank, Xiamen International Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about 14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank's first full year of operation. General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit forecast, saying targets were under study. Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group's outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs, up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters. Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parent company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries <Xiamen International Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and <Luso International Bank Ltd> in Macao. The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985 but did not officially open until March 1986. Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign partner, Hong Kong-listed <Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cut last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign banks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the three Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said. Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of 268,000 dlrs in 1985. The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15, Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10). One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on unequal terms with state-owned banks. The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost saturated, he added. Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank. Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the state-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eight foreign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of Hong Kong or overseas Chinese banks.

KLOECKNER UND CO'S 1986 PROFIT FALLS ABOUT 20 PCT

Kloeckner & Co KGaA, the international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves. The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985. It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary because of recent declines in raw material prices. Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in prices as well as the lower value of the dollar. It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held largely by family foundations. Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield of around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to a quarter of the 1986 payment, or around 2.50 marks, the company added. REUTER 
SWIRE EXPECTS CONTINUED GROWTH THIS YEAR

Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> expects continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said. He told reporters:"1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire Properties expects further good results both from properties under development for sale and from its investment property portfolio." He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago. Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG>. Miles said the company will use the money to develop its business, primarily in Hong Kong. Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from 70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25 pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the enlarged capital to the state-owned <China International Trust and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986 profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago. Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct. He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of "a marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with savings in fuel costs." "At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable for the rest of this year," he said, "though there might be a bit of increase later this year.'' Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service operations, even though the marine sector is generally depressed. "Obviously the marine industry is not getting any better," he said. The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year. Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm but said the firm has no available land for a major housing project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong island now near completion. He said the company's 50 pct unit <Hongkong United Dockyard Ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing estate. "But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing," he said. REUTER 

JOHN LABATT SEES GOOD FOURTH QUARTER, YEAR

<John Labatt Ltd> anticipates a good fourth quarter and a new peak in sales and earnings for the fiscal year ending April 30, president Peter Widdrington told financial analysts. He would not make any specific forecast, but said he was optimistic for further growth in fiscal 1988 in the company's brewing and food products operations. Labatt's earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine months ended January 31 from year-earlier 78 mln dlrs. Revenue for the nine months rose to 3.20 billion dlrs from 2.70 billion dlrs. Widdrington said Labatt's three-year business plan, now being updated, targets total sales of about six billion dlrs, including 2.50 billion dlrs in the U.S. Labatt, Canada's leading brewer, has expanded in the U.S. food products industry by acquisitions. Widdrington said Labatt's strategy for U.S. expansion stemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadian food and beverage industry. The U.S. share of revenues for this year will be about 35 pct, rising to 40 pct in fiscal 1988, he said. Reuter 

SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals Ltd from the Canadian government. The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt fully in 1987, Taylor said. Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and construction acivities, Taylor said. Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small extraordinary gain. In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.

VARITY<VAT> SEES IMPROVED RESULTS AFTER 1ST QTR

Varity Corp, earlier reporting a full year loss against a prior year profit, said improvement is expected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the inventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realized and its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully integrated. However, operating results are likely to remain under pressure in the first quarter ending April 30, it said. Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 ended January 31 of 23.3 mln U.S. dlrs, compared to a year-earlier profit of 3.9 mln dlrs. Varity said continued deterioration in major markets, a weakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major new lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss. Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode during the latest fiscal year, with worldwide industry retail sales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year's depressed levels, the company said. However, Varity increased its share of the global tractor market by more than one pct to 18.2 pct, it said. The combined impact of costly sales incentives and foreign exchange adjustments on margins was substantial, Varity said. Reuter 
LINDE TURNOVER UP IN FIRST TWO MONTHS OF 1987

Engineering group Linde AG's <LING.F> world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same 1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said. But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and incoming orders increased 1.0 pct. Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group 1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln. Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to 394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln. Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13 to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks. Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for acquisitions. He declined to give further details. While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91 billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level. World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4 pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to 739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge. World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05 billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05 billion marks. Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks. The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group sales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders gaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks.

HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES

Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> said in a statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales. The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands. World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in 1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01 billion from 42.72 billion. Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct. The statement made no mention of net profit figures. Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23. In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from 1986, Hoechst said. Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell. Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to <American Hoechst Corp>. Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities. Roussel Uclaf <RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated partners did not perform as well as in 1985. Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in extraordinary costs. The fall in raw material prices was not enough to compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and currencies, Hoechst said. The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the acquisition of <Celanese Corp>. Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to form <Hoechst Celanese Corp>. REUTER 
BHP NET SEEN AROUND 600 MLN DLRS FOR NINE MONTHS

Australia's largest company, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> (BHP), is expected to report a net profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuters said. This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31 1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs. The analysts estimated that the group would report a third quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter. BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier. The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and steel earnings. They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been affected by industrial and production problems. The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP's lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors, and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around 300 mln dlrs. One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on capital expenditure in the steel division, they said. They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900 mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from 1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit. REUTER 

SIEMENS SEES SALES NEAR 52 BILLION MARKS THIS YEAR

World group turnover of Siemens AG <SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said. Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02 billion marks. Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to 21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about 19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct. In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures. In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8 billion marks against the same 1985/86 period. For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion. Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the communications and telecommunications sectors in particular should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said. But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for 1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the dollar, Kaske said. Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the same period in the previous year. Turnover in the first five months rose particularly strongly in the installations and automotive technology, communications and telecommunications sectors, but components and energy and automation showed a sharp decline. Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary. Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad was balanced by the decline in the dollar. While the installations and automotive technology sector showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and communications orders were below the level achieved in the same period of 1985/86. Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same level. Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to 6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover. REUTER 
KRUPP HAS SATISFACTORY 1986 RESULTS

The Fried. Krupp GmbH <KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory 1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to 18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year. Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5 billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from 16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement. Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year. The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales. Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had underpinned machinery and component activities. An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order figures. However, "all business sectors contributed to the positive results achieved in 1986," Krupp added, without giving details. Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9 billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of orders against 40 pct in 1985. Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11 member companies which comprise the core area of the group, rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said. The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year. Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said. The steel market weakened increasingly over the year, mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer industries. The difficult market for sections and flats of quality steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said. But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms. REUTER 

NORCEN SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987 EARNINGS

<Norcen Energy Resources Ltd>, 41 pct owned by <Hees International Corp>, said earnings and cash flow will improve in 1987, even if oil and gas prices remain at 1986 levels. The improvement will result from production increases, lower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and from operating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during 1986, the company said in the annual report. Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings, excluding a 20.1 mln dlr writeoff, declined by 58 pct to 50.0 mln dlrs from 119.7 mln dlrs in in 1985. Norcen's 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 204.9 mln dlrs from 228.9 mln dlrs in the prior year. It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was the most significant factor for Norcen's reduced performance. "While financial results are far from the previous year's record levels, it is clear that Norcen has withstood declining prices and remains financially and operationally strong," Norcen said. It did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast.

BP AUSTRALIA REPORTS 16.15 MLN DLR YEAR LOSS

The <British Petroleum Co of Australia Ltd> reported a 16.15 mln dlr net loss for 1986 against a 73.38 mln dlr profit in 1985 after sales fell to 2.27 billion dlrs from 2.94 billion. The British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> unit attributed the deficit to stock losses arising from the drop in crude prices in the first half, when it made a 119.93 mln dlr loss. It said government compensation, in the form of subsidies to refiners to partially cover stock losses, together with improved crude prices in the second half, enabled the group's oil business to make a modest pre-tax profit. BP Australia said it had not recommended a dividend. Commenting on the year's performance, the company said it suspended operations at the 60 pct-owned Agnew Nickel mine because of losses sustained from declining nickel prices. The results also included an 11.3 mln dlr extraordinary writedown on the value of the laid-up oil exploration drillship Regional Endeavour. BP Australia said it had sold its 33-1/3 stake in chemical maker <CSBP and Farmers Ltd> yielding an extraordinary profit of 18.9 mln dlrs and expected to finalise the sale of the 80 pct-owned <Kwinana Nitrogen Co> in the first half of 1987.

JARDINE MATHESON PLANS FOUR-FOR-ONE BONUS ISSUE

Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd <JARD.HKG> said it planned a bonus issue of four new "B" shares of 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two dlrs. A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total 1987 dividend of four cents per "B" share, while the "A" share dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a share. Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986 net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985. Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from 4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said. It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG>, Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan. He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a reorganisation, is "a long term investment and now stands at a level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset imbalance." Keswick said the issue of new "B" shares will give the group "the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which has been brought about through the group's recent restructuring." He said the new issue is pending approval from both the firm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price. The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation, with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to the new unit <Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two companies spun off from Hk Land -- <Mandarin Oriental International Ltd> and <Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd> -- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson. Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs last year, will become debt free after the restructuring. "A positive cash flow from operations and disposals, continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet," Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities. Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its general trading business in the Middle East in view of the continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said the operations would be profitable in the longer term. He said the firm's function "has evolved into one primarily of strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy." He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific regional board. He gave no further details of the change. Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at midday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it had fallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firm planned a rights issue. REUTER 
BHP SEES STRONG FOURTH QUARTER BUT LOWER YEAR NET

The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> said it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificant investment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but net will fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86 ended May 31. The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to 603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28 from 813.0 mln a year earlier. Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November 31, BHP said in a statement. Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of share analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs. BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1. The bonus is being made from reserves which will not qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of dividend imputation next July 1. The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP said. BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of dividend will be maintained on the increased capital. The level of future dividends will be influenced by the implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation, it said. As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in shareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate. BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln. BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new plant and some operational difficulties. The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said. The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term, reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of <Blue Circle Southern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown. REUTER 

MMAL, 99 pct-owned by Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> and Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.T>, said a tight market meant it had failed to recover 19 mln dlrs in costs sustained because of a weak Australian dollar. The company said its Magna car dominated its market segment with sales of 30,500 units against 26,900 in 1985. Total sales were 64,100, down 15,900. In addition, export of components to Japan increased with 15 mln dlrs invested in 1986 to expand output of aluminium cylinder heads to 26,000 per month from 6,000, MMAL said. Imported passenger car, light commercial and heavy vehicle sales suffered while local-manufacturing profitability was eroded by sales substantially below production capacity, it said. Australian car sales fell to 530,000 in 1985 from 696,000 in 1985, although MMAL said it lifted its market penetration to 12.1 pct from 11.5 pct. No dividend was recommended. REUTER 

THYSSEN SEES GOOD 1987 PROFIT DESPITE STEEL LOSSES

GALACTIC <GALCF> ADOPTS CONSERVATIVE ACCOUNTING

Galactic Resources Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs. As a result, the company retroactively charged all past exploration and related administration costs incurred on its properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984. Under the new policy, all future exploration and related administration costs will be written off to expenses rather than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said. Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results. The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely affect working capital position, future cash flows or the company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it said. Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other mine developments. Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the life of the mine and charged against future earnings. The change will also result in lower depreciation and amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.

BFG PARTIAL OPERATING PROFITS FALL SHARPLY IN 1986

Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F>, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mln marks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholder Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG <AMVG.F>, AMB, said. But total operating and extraordinary profits, including earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's own account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms, were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said. BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB's capital increase, which is to finance the insurance company's acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG. Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company, <Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from which AMB has acquired the majority stake. The bank has said its business last year suffered from the turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing concern Neue Heimat. AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to 50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus. The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from 981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the interest margin to 1.9 pct. A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from 188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this. The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised because of the continuing difficulties of some countries. Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount, rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln. BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in 1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for 14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners. BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01 pct of <Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9 pct of <BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and five pct of <Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linked to AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG. These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer agreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions. REUTER 

ARBED SEES NEED TO MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON COSTS

The recent deterioration in the steel market makes it important for Arbed SA <ARBB.BR> to maintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a statement. It reported that its competitive position had weakened considerably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pct cut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mln tonnes. Arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit, slightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks to lower raw material costs and prudent management, the company said. Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market deteriorate further, but the decision of the European Community to maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally, should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect. EC ministers have agreed to extend a quota production system while discussions continue on an industry plan for capacity reductions. Arbed said in current conditions, cost cutting efforts remain necessary to avoid any weakening of resources which have been built up over the last three years. REUTER 
BASF <BASF.F> SAYS 1986 RESULTS AFFECTED BY DLR

BASF AG said the volatile currency situation last year, particularly the fall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominated in marks and to price reductions for exports from domestic production. But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the group said it expected satisfactory business development over the next months. "At the moment we do not expect any extraordinary influences such as there were last year," it said. Orders in hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level. BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax profit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985. The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and forced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said. The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. In the parent company, the positive earnings development continued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to 1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover was balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in raw materials. In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47 billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell 8.5 pct to 18.72 billion. Turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors fine chemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved in those areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985. Results from these had been taken only partly into the fourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data. So far in the current year, the investment volume of the parent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986, BASF said, without giving concrete figures. REUTER 

CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS

Canada's major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said. American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing. Such action "would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian banks to do the same," Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters. "They (banks) like to appear to be conservative," said Pulcine, "and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not." Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp <CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks. "In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have to have the support of the other banks," said Meredith. Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify, "wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position." Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt. Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days. They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until late May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter ending July 31. <Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bank creditor, said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as non-performing. "I think that is just for the benefit of the public," Walsh said of Bank of Montreal's statement. Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans non-performing. They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income. "From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks will get the money," said Meredith. "My outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's earnings." Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3.80 dlrs for <Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in 1986; 4.30 dlrs for <Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25 dlrs for <Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with 2.23; 2.15 dlrs for <Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94, and 2.85 dlrs for <Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74. She forecast 1.90 dlrs for <National Bank of Canada> against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split. Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share, assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs. "If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share. But I don't see that as a likely scenario," Pulcine said. Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the Brazilian debt situation was so complex that "it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year." He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings. Reuter 
VENEZUELA PLANS METALS INVESTMENT FOR 1987-89

The Venezuela Guayana Corporation, CVG, which oversees the state steel, iron, aluminum and other industries, will invest 75 billion bolivars in new projects during 1987-89, CVG president Leopoldo Sucre Figarella announced. The investments will go to plant expansion, infrastructure and the extension of hydroelectric facilities in the mineral-rich Guayana region, south of the Orinoco river. Sucre Figarella told a news conference the CVG's 12 companies showed an overall increase of 120 pct in profits, which rose from 1.732 billion bolivars in 1985 to 3.926 billion bolivars last year. Among the best performers was steel company Sidor which earned 1.019 billion bolivars, the first time since 1978 Sidor turned a profit. The gain was made possible in part by the refinancing of 1.619 mln dollars of foreign debt. CVG's three aluminum companies also showed substantial gains. Interalumina, which makes the intermediate material alumina, had an increase in profits from 116 to 217 mln bolivars, Alcasa earned 487 mln bolivars, as compared to 1985's 412 mln and Venalum's profits rose by around half, from 1.042 to 1.504 bln bolivars. Meanwhile, the state iron company Ferrominera saw its profits rise from 156 mln bolivars in 1985 to 204 mln bolivars last year. Reuter 

WOODSIDE SAYS LOSS REFLECTS LOWER OIL PRICES

Woodside Petroleum Ltd <WPLA.S> said its 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil prices combined with a large tax provision. Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to 17.14 mln dlrs in 1986 from 8.73 mln in 1985, although group revenue rose to 220.84 mln from 173.50 mln. It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax credit but instead made a 10.04 mln dlr tax provision. This largely related to its <Vamgas Ltd> unit, non-allowable exchange losses and tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not recognised in the accounts. Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full year sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the Shelf project, against six month sales in 1985. Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas and liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit. Since the balance date Woodside has accepted a Santos Ltd <STOS.S> takeover offer for Vamgas. Woodside said a 92.8 mln dlr capital profit on the sale would be included in the 1987 accounts.

A Commerzbank spokesman noted the figures were,however, preliminary and required approval of the bank's supervisory board which meets today. The Commerzbank statement added the distributable profit last year rose to 228.2 mln marks from 161.7 mln in 1985. With inclusion of the corporate tax allowance, qualifying domestic shareholders would receive an effective dividend of 14.06 marks per share. Total dividend payout would rise to 186.8 mln marks from 142.0 mln on 1985 earnings due to the increase in the dividend and in equity capital, it added. From the parent net profit, 60 mln marks would be placed in published reserves, unchanged from the two prior years. The shareholders' meeting take place on May 22 in Hamburg. The statement said holders of Commerzbank participation certificates in a total nominal value of 425 mln marks would receive the remaining 41.4 mln marks of the distributable profit. Aside from the basic payment of 8.25 pct of nominal value, certificate holders would receive an additional 1.5 pct. The management board of the bank would also propose two capital measures to shareholders in order to be able to react quickly to new challenges. It would ask for authorised capital of a nominal 200 mln marks for the issue of new shares and for 300 mln for the issue of warrant bonds, both for the period until April 30, 1992. REUTER 

MANNESMANN SEES DIFFICULT YEAR FOR CAPITAL GOODS

Mannesmann AG <MMWG.F> expects a difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief executive Werner Dieter told a news conference. Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer nations. Domestic business was also declining and orders for West German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986, Dieter said. Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986. Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started last year, were now having an effect. Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter said had become one of Mannesmann's "strategic aims." He said the company's drive to combine activities in mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "plus point" for Mannesmann. Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks. It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar and lack of demand for steel pipe. Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this year. REUTER 

Esso Malaysia Bhd, a unit of Exxon Corp of the U.S., Reported net profit of 70 mln ringgit from its petroleum and ammonia operations in 1986 compared with 48.7 mln in 1985. Chairman Gerald F Cox said the improved performance was mainly due to product prices falling more slowly than crude prices during the year. He added that total sales volume increased as a result of higher offtake by affiliated companies, while inland market sales were maintained at around the previous year's levels. But growth prospects in 1987 remained weak and 1986 results are unlikely to be repeated in the current financial year. REUTER 

CANADA'S AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER

Canada's airline industry, shaken up by a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said. "Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada," said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. "Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market." The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week as Canadian Airlines International Ltd. Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the 6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's 50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine pct. Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd. They said CP Air's management style had been not much different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because neither airline was held accountable to its owners. "Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither seemed that concerned about the bottom line," said Bradley. "But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air Canada is on the verge of going that way," he said. CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than profits, was "a perennial money-loser," analyst Wilfred Hahn of Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report. Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs. Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more than 2 billion dlrs. Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more attention to finances, analysts said. It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit "in excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs" for 1986. However, this profit recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said. Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year, attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors. For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from cost-cutting and careful spending. Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new competition makes profit growth less certain. "The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody else's," Friend said. Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline shares for at least a year. Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes without setting off a political storm. It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft. Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later, already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie. Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the Boeing Co. Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet, needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without hurting profits. Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8 mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western. Reuter 

DOME PETE<DMP> TAKES 2.08 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN

Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier profit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs. The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses, the company said. "The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses much of the progress the company has made in the two previous years," Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement. "But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome," chairman Macdonald said. "It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the company's assets in today's economic environment, and the absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued existence," he added. Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs. Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan. Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining period of the loans to which they apply, it said. Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20 billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of 305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in the third quarter. Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. The company said it previously determined a write down of conventional oil and gas properties was not required at September 30, under the previous method of calculating the limitation of oil and gas values. Dome said the most significant accounting change under the new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in calculations instead of escalating price forecasts. Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude the company from making an accurate estimate of future financing costs, which are used in the new accounting calculations, it said. As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10 pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said. Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71 billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs. Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue. Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also contributed to the decline, it said. Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79 pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985. Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago 542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0 mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs. Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and improvements in productivity. Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of lower domestic and export sales, it said. Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled 86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year. Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day from 591.0 mcf a day.

COMMERZBANK SEES LOWER OPERATING PROFIT THIS YEAR

Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be lower than in 1986. In the first two months of the year, partial operating profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account - declined, he said, without giving details. The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of 1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly. By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased. German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp said last year the figure for the first time had topped one billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was around 50 pct higher than this. Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, "we were able to raise the full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of 1985 because own account profits increased slightly." He gave no concrete details but added that in January and February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the partial operating figure. The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in future, developing, for example, more into investment banking, keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening expenditures on fixed assets. Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had been a strong growth in business volume. Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2 billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added. Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15 billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher still if currency relationships had remained unchanged. In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56 pct despite pressure on credit rates. The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said. Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct to more than 650 mln. As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks. Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year from 233 mln in 1985. Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a "high two-figure million" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG <AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F> during the latter's majority stake purchase booked last year. The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in credit business against profits from securities trading and earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior years, to its full extent. Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of credit exposure to provisions improved further. Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks. "This means that no open currency positions exist any longer on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual default," he added. Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is better armed than it was against payment problems. All banks had significantly strengthened their capital base, most European banks had made considerable provisions against bad debts while goverments and central banks were better prepared for unforseen difficulties. He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new approach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of interest in direct investment via an equity participation in Latin America, particularly from West German firms. Reuter 

THYSSEN SEES UP TO 20 PCT LOWER SALES IN 1986/87

Thyssen AG <THYH.F> expects a fall of between 15 and 20 pct in consolidated turnover in 1986/87, chief executive Dieter Spethmann said. He told journalists the exact decline would depend on dollar developments. The Thyssen group did over 50 pct of its business outside West Germany. Spethmann made no comment on 1986/87 group earnings. World group net profit fell to 370.1 mln marks in the year ended September 1986 from 472.4 mln a year earlier on group sales which fell to 40.00 billion marks from a previous 44.32 billion. Last week Spethmann told the annual meeting Thyssen expected to post a good profit in 1986/87 despite expected losses in the mass steel-making operations this year. Spethmann said engineering turnover would not be lower this year, but lower steel prices would result in a drop in steel turnover and sales volume. This would also affect Thyssen's trading operations, he said. Spethmann also categorically denied a magazine article published this week which spoke of a dispute between him and Heinz Kriwet, management board chairman of Thyssen Stahl AG, over planned job cuts in steel plants in the Ruhr area.

DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987

Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> has seen a slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference. Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78 billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion. Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank's own account, not included in partial operating profits. Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest surplus in a section current earnings from securities and participations. In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from 1.45 billion. As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits. But it said that total operating profits, including own account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the parent bank. Banking analysts said this put group total operating profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank operating profits at over five billion marks. Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its unchanged 12 mark dividend. The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986, and developments so far this year showed that was correct, Christians said. West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits. The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a high level of risk provision, Christians said. Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in 1986 from 765 mln in 1985. Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily reflect the full amount of risk provisions. Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985 because of the fall in the dollar. He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of such problem country debt had been written off. Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of "other securities," to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the parent bank. Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due to its increased activity in international share placements, with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international placement last year remaining on its books. Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to place these shares and conclude the original placement. Reuter 
SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH

Singapore's major banks are diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from loans to debt instruments, banking sources said. The banks following the trend are the <Overseas Union Bank Ltd>, <United Overseas Bank Ltd>, <Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation> and the <Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>. The shift towards securitisation has been helped by volatile financial markets which have developed hedging facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun. Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are switching from term lending to major growth areas such as stockbroking and fee based income, he said. Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now moving into the new government securities market and the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System. One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity market in Singapore. Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has increased business transactions and provided long term growth for the market. The banks are not competition for individual stockbroking firms because of the increased business they generate, he added. Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because of the increasing ability of foreign and local market participants to absorb new issues. Loh said <OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors seeking capital growth through a diversified international portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said. <DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm. Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be forced to provide fund management services for major clients seeking better returns, he said. Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from treasury and investment banking activities. They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986. Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40 mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said. The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in 1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by <National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary of the bank, they said. REUTER 
BAYER CONFIDENT OF POSTING GOOD 1987 RESULTS

Chemicals group Bayer AG <BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987 after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986. The company said that this was despite the mark's further strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and despite an increase in competitive pressure. "The further progress of our business will depend largely on the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy costs. Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15 billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72 billion from 1.62 billion. The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985 results, up one mark from a year earlier. Bayer said that world group operating profit declined slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed a further improvement. Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to 40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark. Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought pressure on selling prices, it added. In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against 1985, the company said without giving details. "The western Europe, North America and Far East regions developed well in local currency, but here too the translation of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture, especially in the case of North America," it said. Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in 1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks. Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986, resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset falling prices and cost increases in other areas. The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income. Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw materials all developed well, it said. Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period. Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower. Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985. REUTER 

WESTLB LUXEMBOURG REPORTS LOWER 1986 NET PROFIT

Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale <WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB International SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6 mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier. WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier. The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of 1987 developed positively, it added. WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in 1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks. Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from 10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new lending. The statement said WestLB International's business with private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year. This development was aided by cooperation between the bank and the savings banks in the West German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based. Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of 1.1 billion. WestLB International said it plans to expand its range of services for private clients. REUTER 

GERMAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SEES LOWER PROFITS

West Germany's chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said. Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG <BAYG.F>, told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices. Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986. The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said. Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs. Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact. Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany. The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East. Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct. Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year. REUTER 
WESSANEN FORESEES STRONG PROFIT GROWTH

Dutch dairy and general foods manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV <WESS.AS>, said it is planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong profit growth over the next 10 years. Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987 first quarter profits to show an increase. The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985. This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's guilder value, van Driel said. Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985 level of 3.20 guilders. Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders. US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover, compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide. Van Driel said the company would continue an active takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit. He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China. He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln guilders and would if necessary make new share issues. Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln dlrs. He said <Balanced Foods> and <Green's Dairy>, taken over late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs which was not included in the 1986 account. All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13 pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to this growth was the successful introduction of new products, which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US acquisitions, van Driel said. Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986 turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said. The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich, Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said. Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles for the company to raise capital for future expansion. He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in foreign hands. The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step, van Driel said without elaborating. Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said. REUTER 

CONSOLIDATED-BATHURST SEES BETTER MARKET

(Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said it expects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the second half of 1986 to continue this year. The continued improvement would be due to good market demand, better product prices and high operating capacity, the company said in its annual report. Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of 104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar, B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute to equity earnings. Last year's results were up from 1985 operating profit of 80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs. The company said it views its near-term prospects with improved optimism. It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the U.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity and production and more favorable market conditions. It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987 for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2 mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, and expects higher sales and earnings for its other North American packaging divisions. Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa Carton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputes between the United States and the European Economic Community on the West German economy and the higher value of the mark may lead to increased costs which could not be offset by price increases.

CITIBANK NORWAY UNIT LOSES SIX MLN CROWNS IN 1986

Citibank A/S <CCI.N>, the Norwegian subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years. Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices. Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in Norway since 1985. Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year. Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel. Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's <CMB.N> subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking. REUTER 

JARDINE MATHESON REPLACES "B" SHARE BY BONUS ISSUE

Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd <JARD.HK> said it will withdraw the previously announced four-for-one bonus issue of "B" shares and replace it by a two-for-five bonus issue of ordinary shares. A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded capital. Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a joint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, and Securities Commissioner Ray Astin, that the listings of new "B" shares would be barred. The official announcement said this will include the proposal by Jardine Matheson. But the Jardine statement quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying: "We continue to believe that the issuing of "B" shares would benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage." Keswick said the "B" share issue will benefit Jardine Matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue ordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting existing shareholders' voting rights. However, he added: "We certainly welcome (the Secretary for Monetary Affairs) David Nendick's referral of this very important matter to the Standing Committee on Company Law Reform and are hopeful that the process will lead to the development of general principles which can be embraced by all constituents of the Hong Kong market."

VOLKSWAGEN DIVIDEND DECISION DUE TOMORROW

Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud. A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout. A statement will be made afterwards. VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit. When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the company's new preference shares. Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. "Anything else would be more than a surprise," one said. Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to maintain the disclosed profit.

HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION

Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration. Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders, after 265 mln in 1985. Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986, said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters. The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S., Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe, where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total. Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders. Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery <El Aguila S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing, Heineken said. Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year. Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "We have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important point," van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures. "The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market, but how we are to do it," van Schaik said, adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very regionalized. Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term. He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there. Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales. On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities. To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which had sold successfully, Coebergh said. Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility, but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor," Coebergh said. Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced. But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western money. Reuter 

PHILIPPINE TELEPHONE FIRM PLANS STOCK SPLIT

The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co <PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters. Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the company's common stock from 10 to five pesos. He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18 mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15 1987. "The exercise should make our stock more marketable," Lazo said. "Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors." PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February 1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila Stock Exchange. Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15, would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15. PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68 pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985. At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders. A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax from which it was previously exempt. The government has not so far ordered the implementation of the tax decision. PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014 telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments in the country.

CCF REPORTS 34.8 PCT PROFIT BOOST, SHARE SPLIT SEEN

Credit Commercial de France <CCFP.PA> reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its denationalisation around the end of this month. Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets, planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad. Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was nationalised by the Socialists in 1982. The sources said it was too early to give details of the planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a likely date for the flotation launch. So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33 mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to ten shareholders before the flotation. The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday. "The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients," CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters. Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisation at between four and five billion francs. De la Serre said the bank was likely to attract at least the same number of investors as <Sogenal>, another recently privatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares. The government's sweeping privatisation programme has also included the sale of Saint-Gobain <SGEP.PA>, and Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA>.

The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressured by falls in exchange rates, particularly in the US and Australian dollar and sterling. Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher, NatNed said. The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986 compared with 52 pct in 1985. The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln guilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences, tighter interest margins and increased investment. Claim payouts fell to 9.9 mln guilders after 66.6 mln the previous year. The company's total assets reached 69.87 billion guilders in 1986 against 67 billion the year before. Assets per share equalled 65.68 guilders against 65.53. Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher, NatNed said.

AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS

Dutch insurer AEGON NV <AEGN.AS> reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits for 1987. Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred. Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly due to its life insurance business. Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks. Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss. In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities. AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances. This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments, resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders. AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague. In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat. Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these costs and made only a small contribution to the group's profits. AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill for Monumental Corp. AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December 1986, against 3.46 billion the year before. REUTER 

VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES

Losses for Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW spokesman said. The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business, despite the provision. One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit." VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company. VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed. VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice. Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders. VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares. The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly less than three billion marks. REUTER 

Moore Corp Ltd expects 1987 profits from continuing operations will exceed 1986 results and recover to 1985 levels when the company earned 152 mln U.S. dlrs or 1.70 dlrs a share, president M. Keith Goodrich said. "We'll have a substantial increase in earnings from continuing operations," he told reporters after the annual meeting. He said he expected profits would recover last year's lost ground and reach 1985 results. In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to 139.5 mln dlrs or 1.54 dlrs a share. The total excluded losses of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations. Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for acquisitions related to its core areas of business forms manufacturing or handling. "We could do a large acquisition," he said when asked if the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this purpose. Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder's question, told the annual meeting that a special resolution passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred shares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided to pursue an acquisition. "If we were to make a major acquisition ... it means we can move with a certain expediency," Sinclair said. Asked if the resolution was designed to give Moore protection from a possible hostile takeover, Sinclair said only, "I know of no threat to the corporation at this time." Reuter 

MOBIL AUSTRALIA REPORTS 38.6 MLN DLR 1986 LOSS

Wholly-owned Mobil Corp <MOB> unit, <Mobil Oil Australia Ltd>, reported a 38.63 mln dlr net loss in 1986, a turnaround from its 37.25 mln profit in 1985. The loss reflected a combination of strikes plus scheduled and unscheduled refinery shutdowns for maintenance and inventory losses caused by government controls on both crude and product prices, Mobil said in a statement. However, equity-accounting of associates' profits reduced the loss to 24 mln dlrs against a 37 mln profit in 1985. Mobil said it was confident 1987 would see a return to profit as it built further on its 1985 company restructuring. REUTER 
ANZ BANK SETS ONE-FOR-TWO BONUS ISSUE

Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> said it will make a one-for-two bonus issue from its asset revaluation reserve to shareholders registered June 2. The proposed bonus and an increase in authorised capital to one billion one-dlr par shares from 600 mln will be put to shareholders for approval at an extraordinary general meeting on May 26, the ANZ said in a statement. The issue will absorb about 230 mln dlrs of the 260.9 mln standing in the asset revaluation reserve, it said. The bank said that by lowering the dividend rate it expects to maintain the value of dividend payout on the enlarged capital at about the level of its last full year ended September 30. The group paid 31 cents a share and 133.1 mln dlrs in all for that year. Shareholders will also be asked to approve changes in the bank's articles of association to allow it to offer shares in lieu of the interim dividend at a discount of five pct to the market price. The group is the latest to announce a tax-free bonus issue ahead of dividend imputation, effective July 1. REUTER 

GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS

Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. "Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts," he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. "Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had "clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region." In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said. REUTER 
ZAMBIA TO RETAIN CURRENCY AUCTION, SAYS KAUNDA

Zambia will retain its foreign-exchange auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said. "We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been abolished at all," he told Reuters in an interview. He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds. Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate. Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand. It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector, he said. Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months. In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

Subscriptions to 300 mln guilders were met in full, amounts above 300 mln at 50 pct. The new facility replaces old five-day advances worth 8.0 billion guilders at the same rate. Dealers expect this week's money market shortage to be around 12 billion guilders. Reuter 

PHILIPPINE PLANNING CHIEF URGES PESO DEVALUATION

The Philippines must devalue the peso if it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters. "The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive," Monsod said an interview. "No question about it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies." The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar. Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions. Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance. "If the dollar rate goes higher, our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the financing is very difficult," she said. "But I am looking at it in terms of the economy." She said she was not trying to oppose official policy. "I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead." Monsod said, "The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic thing." Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year. He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80. The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the dollar when it was floated in 1984. REUTER 
SAUDI RIYAL DEPOSIT RATES EASE

Saudi riyal interbank deposit rates eased across the board in a dull market which was long in day-to-day funds, dealers said. Today's quiet market continued a lull of several days in which traders were said to be waiting on the sidelines ahead of further clues to the direction of oil prices and the Saudi economy. Dealers cited some borrowing interest in two, three, and six-month deposits but said activity focused on short dates and one-month deposits as banks tried to lend surplus funds. Spot-next was put at 5-3/4, 5-1/4 pct, down from six, 5-1/2 yesterday while one-week rates were steady at six, 5-1/2 pct. One-month deposits declined to 6-1/4, 1/8 pct from 6-1/2, 1/4 on Monday, while three months was barely changed at seven, 6-15/16 pct. The spot riyal was little changed at 3.7501/03 to the dollar after quotes of 3.7498/7501 yesterday. REUTER 
DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT BARELY CHANGED IN WEEK

Loans and advances from the Dutch central bank to the commercial banks were barely changed at 12.9 billion guilders in the week up to and including March 2, the central bank weekly return showed. The Treasury's account with the bank dropped 1.3 billion guilders. Dealers said a larger amount of funds in the form of interest and repayments on state loans went out than came in the form of tax payments to the state. Notes in circulation rose 360 mln to 27.7 billion as the public withdrew cash to celebrate this week's Carnival festival or take an end-of-winter holiday break, dealers said.

N. ZEALAND MARKETS PREPARE FOR TRADING BANK STRIKE

New Zealand clearing house <DataBank Systems Ltd> said it will know tomorrow what services it will be able to provide during a strike by bank officers against trading banks and DataBank set for March 9 and 10. Trading banks polled by Reuters said their ability to offer money market services during the strike depends on whether Databank remains open, and whether the banks have enough staff to process transactions. A spokesman for the New Zealand Foreign Exchange Association said dealers would be able to trade during the strike. But the spokesman added that from March 6 to 10 the value date of currency transactions will be March 16. Trading bank spokesmen told Reuters they will try to honour transactions in which an offshore party sought payment on March 9 or 10, but they could not guarantee settlement. The Futures Exchange said trading members and their clients will be able to continue trading provided they have made suitable financial arrangements.

NIGERIAN CURRENCY FIRMS AT LATEST AUCTION

The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct against the dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at today's weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said. The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 last week. Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold, with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency. The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last week. The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as punishment for inadequate documentation in previous transactions. Banks are required to submit proof that their bids are based on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has complained in the past that many are failing to produce the right paperwork within the specified time.

FRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY, DEALERS SAY

The Bank of France is likely to cut its money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week. This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said. The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence. The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February 23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3, where it has now stabilised. Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct. While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide. The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5. The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while using the intervention rate to set the floor. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday, although an earlier cut could not be excluded. A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning, banking sources said. They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving scope for a small fall in rates. M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished 1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target, rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985. REUTER 

FRENCH PRIMARY BOND MARKET SHOWS NEW SPARKLE

The French primary bond market is showing signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said. The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5. The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate, the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this week, dealers noted. The Bank of France's "open market" policy to regulate the money markets since December has been based on a floor and ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and seven day repurchase rates. For the moment the sentiment is of "wait and see" on rate cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said. Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of 11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily absorbed. The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12 billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said. Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity in the primary market at the moment despite competition from the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange. There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand - with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees. Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March 9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct. Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said. Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest focussed on the likely three next issues. These will include an expected four to five billion franc issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de Refinancement Hypothecaire.

BANK OF ZAMBIA PAYS OUT FOREIGN CURRENCY ARREARS

The Bank of Zambia has paid out foreign exchange arrears from three auctions conducted last year, a bank spokesman said. "We have now cleared three auctions and are left with only four, worth eight mln dlrs," the spokesman said without specifying the amount paid out. The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28. It has said the auctions were suspended because it planned to introduce a modified system after talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that the auction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange to approved private sector bidders, but would not be used to determine the kwacha's exchange rate. Last week, he said the auction had run into trouble because of a shortage of foreign exchange. The government has fixed the exchange rate at nine kwacha per dollar, effectively revaluing the kwacha by 67.7 pct. REUTER 

WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN

A confidential World Bank report on the Peruvian economy has said the government's strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure. The report, published today by the economic monthly, The Peru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia's government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth in gross domestic product of over eight pct "represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long." Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment program and greater emphasis on the preservation of Peru's export potential. The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation program was encountering rising difficulties. "An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable," it added. The world bank report said the government's policies had reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at the apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of the currency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses, and sharply diminished creditworthiness. It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a competitive exchange rate and control the public sector deficit, "the higher the probability will be that the government will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the balance of payments." It said the bank would place more emphasis on the preservation of peru's export potential, external links and overall economic efficiency. The government's incentive policies towards the mining and petroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports, suggested that it did not accord high priority to their economic viability, it added.

INDONESIAN BANKS RAISE INTEREST RATES

A tight money market has pushed interest rates on three to six month time deposits to between 15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said. March is usually a tight month for the money market because of tax payments and banks' need to attract funds for their year-end accounts on March 31. This year the situation has been made worse by December's rush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared imposition of exchange controls. Much of that outflow has yet to be converted back into rupiah. "A lot of small money has come back in, but the big money is holding out until after April," one U.S. Banker said. The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, is helping to keep rates high. Short-term lending rates now average 25 pct a year, with no prospect they will be lowered soon, the bankers said. Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this week that Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects in 1987/88, but added the "speculators" who led a run on the rupiah late last year could again pose problems. Indonesia holds general elections on April 23, the first in five years, and most businessmen expect no new government economic packages or incentives before then. "Some people are nervous about what the government will do after the election," one banker said. "They normally try to do things before the IGGI (Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia) meeting (in June) to prove they are doing something about the economy to show they deserve a couple of billion dollars." The IGGI, which groups 14 industrialised donor countries and four agencies, gave Indonesia 2.5 billion dlrs in soft loans and grants last year. REUTER 

HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT

National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year's severe trade deficit with the West. Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade. "It is useful to have a devaluation," he said. "There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports." The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow. He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986). This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added. Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year. But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985. Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs. One Western commercial attache here said: "Devaluation of itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods." Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry. It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market. Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen. He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation. "I am for credits to invest for that purpose," he said. "I am against credits for consumption." He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986. Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low. Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints.

BANKERS OPPOSE STRICT TAIWAN CURRENCY CONTROLS

Taiwan imposed currency controls today in what bankers called a desperate move to prevent speculation as the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. currency. The strict controls will require proof that large remittances to Taiwan are connected to commercial transactions rather than currency speculation. Bankers attacked the controls as ineffective, saying they were a panic reaction to pressure from Washington for faster appreciation of the Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar, which would slow exports to the United States. Remittances exceeding one mln dlrs earned through exports, shipping, insurance or bank lending will now need government approval, along with remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source.

PERU BEGINS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATIONING

Peru will put into effect Monday a foreign exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide in the country's international reserves, a government decree in the Official Gazette said. Under the system, importers will be required to present a bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange. Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago. The system will be effective until the end of 1988. A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank, the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in accordance with guidelines set by the council. Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in 1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates. Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against 2.97 billion in 1985. Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product grew by about 8.5 pct, the highest economic growth level registered in 12 years. Imports were about 2.49 billion dlrs in 1986 against 1.87 billion in 1985, according to preliminary estimates. The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard-line debt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14.3 billion dlr foreign debt. REUTER 
ZAMBIA, IMF TALKS HIT PROBLEMS OVER FOOD SUBSIDIES

Zambia's talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an official newspaper said. The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction. The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart. According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude its talks with the government on schedule on March 23. The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its talks with the government have taken longer than expected. REUTER 
TREASURY, FOREIGN RESERVES ARE JORDAN'S PRIORITIES

Jordan's key economic priorities are having a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange reserves, Prime Minister Zeid al-Rifa'i said. "First, the national treasury should be in sound shape when dealing with the public and other countries so that its credibility is preserved," he said in a television interview Saturday. "The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of foreign exchange reserves to provide (the) stability and confidence needed by the government to meet foreign commitments." Rifa'i said Jordan's outstanding government-guaranteed and commercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio of 14.9 pct. The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars in outstanding loans at the end of September, according to latest Central Bank figures. Rifa'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists here that the dinar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies, is overvalued. "The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve its stability," he said. The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would tackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan. Under a 10-year agreement reached in 1978, Jordan was to receive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help it resist Israel. But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations, while the others failed because of falling income due to lower oil prices. REUTER 

The system will be effective until the end of 1988. A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank, the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in accordance with guidelines set by the council. Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in 1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates. Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against 2.97 billion in 1985. Reuter 
BANK OF FRANCE LEAVES MONEY MARKET INTERVENTION RATE UNCHANGED AT 7-3/4 PCT - OFFICIAL



ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY

The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. "The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common," said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. "Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict. REUTER 
SPAIN TO RELAX EXCHANGE CONTROLS

The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the ending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said. "The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with deregulation in the banking industry," he said in a telephone interview. The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday. The central bank said in a statement the measures included increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision for future pension fund obligations. It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate Spain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the Community last year. Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches. Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets. Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas. The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans. The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days. Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper. They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits. Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies, instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency. The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited to three times a bank's capital equity. The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates. The reserve requirement, which was already in place on normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government's money supply growth target. A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors. The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation. "The real problem is the freeing of interest rates," the banker said. "This is going to take a big bite out of profits." The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days. The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year. REUTER 

MARKET WELCOMES LOWER AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS DEFICIT

The Australian dollar rose more than 40 points and money market interest rates retreated on the better than expected improvement in the February current account deficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about identifying it as the start of a downward trend. The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion dlrs in 1985/86 to end-June. The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69. "It's got 69 cents written all over it," one dealer said. Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30 points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release. The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one billion dlrs for March. Banque National de Paris <BNPP.A> senior dealer Peter Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and interest rates were too high for import substitution and export industries. Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875 and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow. <Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose said the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at 2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January. But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal exports remained poor. "We should remember we are paying something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near term," Buttrose said. Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln dlrs, and added "Any figure under a billion dollars will be acceptable (to the markets)." ANZ Banking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> senior economist Ian Little said the big question was whether the improvement in exports could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January. Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with 90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65. Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday. The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said the current account data had little impact on trading. REUTER 

TAIWAN SAID CONSIDERING CURRENCY LIBERALISATION

Taiwan's central bank is considering proposals to ease currency restrictions to reduce foreign exchange reserves of 51 billion U.S. Dlrs, a local newspaper reported today. The China Times, which has close ties with the government, quoted central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng as saying the government had agreed in principle to liberalise financial restrictions. The bank was considering proposals to allow firms and individuals to hold foreign exchange and invest in foreign stocks for the first time, Chang was quoted as saying. All foreign exchange must now be handed to local banks and exchanged for local currency. Firms and individuals may only invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit. Central bank and other government officials were not available to comment on the report. Economists said it was likely that the government would ease foreign exchange controls, but only gradually. They said vast foreign currency reserves, earned mainly from huge trade surpluses with the United States, made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year compared with 10.2 billion in 1985. "The central bank has to go in this direction," said Su Han-min, chief economist with the International Commercial Bank of China.

ZAMBIAN EXCHANGE AUCTION TO RESUME AT END OF MARCH

Zambia will reintroduce a modified foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a new two-tier exchange rate, central bank governor Leonard Chivuno said. Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other types of business. The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the end of January. President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted. Business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful bidders. The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later. Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar. REUTER 
GULF ARAB MINISTERS DISCUSS ECONOMIC COOPERATION

Finance and economy ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting to discuss further economic integration, officials said. They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank governors on a common currency exchange rate. The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year. The six states have different currency systems. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar. Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by itself. The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket. Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint economic agreements "is increasingly linking the interests of GCC citizens together." The general assembly of the Gulf Investment Corporation met in Abu Dhabi earlier under the chairmanship of Bahrain's Finance and National Economy Minister, Ibrahim Abdul-Karim The corporation was formed to contribute to joint economic and investment projects in the GCC.

U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE

The Bank of England said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after forecasting a shortage in the system of around 1.1 billion stg. Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could be taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Base lending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in the discount market. Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today, possibly of one point, following yesterday's budget in which the U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashed by three billion stg. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and bankers' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg and 20 mln stg respectively. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add some 140 mln stg to the system today. REUTER 

GULF ARAB STATES MOVE TOWARDS ECONOMIC INTEGRATION

Finance and economy ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have ended talks after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at boosting economic integration. But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a resolution on a common currency exchange rate system. The UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank governors for further discussion. He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia. Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to discuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a new system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year. The denominator approved by the governors has not been made public, but banking sources said it could be similar to the European Monetary System (EMS). Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state. They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms. He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods containing radiation caused by last year's Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union, and agreed all products with excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin.

FORMER N.Z. PREMIER CALLS FOR CHEAPER CURRENCY

Former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N.Z. Dollar, said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued. Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate should be around 48 U.S. Cents instead of the current 57 cents. "A reasonable value for the New Zealand dollar would be between 10 and 15 pct less and nearer 15 than 10. Perhaps around about 48 cents," he said. The Labour Party government removed exchange controls and floated the dollar two years ago when it was worth 44 cents. Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party, and party leaders, with an eye to general elections to be held by September, have rejected his calls for a managed float. He said the dollar was high because of "grossly excessive" interest rates for government stock. "I know of no other country which is implementing such a free floating policy," he added. "There is widespread agreement internationally that we have no alternative to floating currencies in the short to medium term. But we need more effective methods of managing them so as to limit the volatility which has caused so much concern and damage." REUTER 

S.AFRICA'S FINANCIAL RAND SEEN HEADED HIGHER

The financial rand, widely viewed as a direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in South Africa, appears headed above 30 U.S. Cents, dealers and bank economists said. The currency has risen about 25 pct in the past three months to its current rate of 29.50 cents, due partly to signs of a possible power shift with the appearance of a number of independent candidates in the whites-only election on May 6, they added. It has risen about two cents this week alone. "Another factor is that banks in London, where the main market is based, are going long in the currency because of a general feeling that it will rise in the future," one economist said. Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier that was expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidation phase from recent gains. After reaching 30 cents, "There is a chance of appreciation to 32 cents in the next several weeks," one dealer said. There was a widespread feeling that both the commercial rand, holding stable at 48 cents, and the financial rand were staying firm, banking sources said. A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to be identified said: "The rise of the independents appears to be indicative of a potential shift of power in the National Party and has created a favourable sentiment overseas." One dealer said growing business and investor interest from West Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rand's rise. Economists said foreigners also were being attracted by South Africa's long-term government bonds and "semi-gilts" or securities in partly government-owned firms, many with yields as high as 30 pct. They could be purchased with financial rands with interest paid in commercial rands. "This has had a definite influence on the financial form of the rand," a dealer said, adding that at present demand is slightly in excess of supply. The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 to help end capital flight from South Africa during a period of severe political unrest in the country. REUTER 

ITALIAN PANEL URGES EXCHANGE LIBERALIZATION

Liberalization of Italy's foreign exchange controls should be "gradual" but also "reasonably rapid," a report issued by a study committee nominated by the Italian Treasury Ministry said. The report, looking at the country's financial development prospects, said Italy's large public sector deficit and growing public debt were among the considerations that made a gradual liberalization preferable. The report also favoured retention of the lira's six pct oscillation band with the European Monetary System (EMS) during the liberalization process in order to lessen short-term domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from portfolio adjustments. The lira's fluctuation margin is currently significantly higher than that allowed for other EMS currencies. Italy has over recent months announced a series of deregulation moves in response to a European Community directive aimed at creating a genuine common market in goods, services and finance by 1992.

SHORT-TERM YEN INTEREST RATES SEEN FALLING SOON

Japanese short-term interest rates, buoyed recently by seasonal factors, are likely to fall from the beginning of April when the new financial year begins, money traders said. The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trend following its attempts to pressure rates to enhance its discount rate cut on February 23, they said. The Bank cut the rate to 2.5 pct from three, and began actively injecting funds into the money market to offset rate rises resulting from the end-of-fiscal-year surge in demand for funds from financial institutions. Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such as aggressive commercial bill purchases, the central bank has failed to remove all upward pressure, money traders said. Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks to compete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen has underpinned short-term rates, they said. Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yen were decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September. This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks rising to 17,830 billion yen by the end-December, a three-fold increase on end-December 1985 levels, bankers said. On March 31, the money market expects to see a 2,000 billion yen surplus resulting from government payment of fiscal funds, money traders said. From April 1, they predict the unconditional call rate will fall to 3.5000 pct from 3.7500 pct today and the one-month commercial bill discount rate to drop to 3.7500 pct from 4.0635 pct. They predict the three-month bill discount rate to slip to 3.875 pct from 4.0000 today and the three-month certificate of deposit rate to slide to 4.10/4.15 from 4.35/25. REUTER 

BANK OF FINLAND TO TRADE IN BANKS' CERTIFICATES

The Bank of Finland said it has started dealings in banks' certificates of deposits (CDs) with immediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its own paper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market. Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money market from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum credit amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling. "The recent introduction of three-month money and these new regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market and the discount rate as monetary instruments," Kullberg said. Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs, they said. "The central bank for the first time has an instrument with which it really can influence the price of money in this country," one banker said. Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now introduced if the limit is exceeded. Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland's monetary department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy on the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs. "We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the first, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think we will issue at least a few times a week," Korkman told Reuters. He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a three-month maturity at first as the market was best developed for paper of that maturity. The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-month credits and deposits at rates determined by the central bank and the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditional overnight call money market. Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around nine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week, while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion. On the interbank market there has been an increasing trade in banks' CDs, estimated to be some eight billion markka. In addition, commercial paper accounts for around five billion markka and Treasury Bills two billion. REUTER 

Zimbabwe's Reserve Bank, the nation's central bank, has denied the Zimbabwe dollar would be devalued. Bank Governor Kombo Moyana told The Herald daily newspaper "unfortunate and completely unfounded speculation that a depreciation of the Zimbabwe dollar was about to occur" had aggravated a serious foreign exchange shortage.

NIGERIA CHANGES AUCTION RULES TO DEFEND THE NAIRA

Nigeria's Central Bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency, which has depreciated steadily. The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction. This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower "marginal" rate, analysts said. "It should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered," a Western diplomat commented. The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM), began last September 26. At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at 4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row. "They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend," the diplomat said. The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2. It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday's scheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction. Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira. If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective of the new system, analysts said. Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the lowest successful bid. SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustment program, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in Black Africa. The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising imports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy. The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards. Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria, said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions. "So far so good" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos, adding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit. Fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect, he said. Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira's black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last September. REUTER 

The Bank of Spain raised overnight call money rates by 1/4 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas in today's auction, which a bank spokesman termed "heavy." Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds, the spokesman said. He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could rise further if money supply growth rose above this year's eight pct target for M-4, defined as liquid assets in public hands. Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986. A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation. The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year. "Money supply control is the government's chief weapon against inflation," he said. "The problem is higher rates are attracting liquidity from abroad." He said this was why the central bank enacted specific measures to control the inflow of foreign capital. The Bank of Spain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curb short-term speculative capital from abroad. REUTER 
SUDAN REJECTS IMF DEMAND FOR DEVALUATION

Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods. SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan. Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year. In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency. Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers. Dealers in Khartoum's thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today. With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire. Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan's economic performance. The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country's economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears. This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments. Twenty-three pct of Sudan's total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said. Sudan's Finance Minister said last month the country's IMF representative had told him the fund's executive board was "very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months." The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more. Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30. REUTER 

BANK OF FRANCE LAUNCHES MONEY MARKET INTERVENTION TENDER - OFFICIAL



BANK OF FRANCE LAUNCHES MONEY MARKET TENDER

The Bank of France said it set a money market intervention tender today to inject funds to the market against first category paper. Money market sources said the surprise announcement might herald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank intervention rate from the 7-3/4 pct level set March 10, but they added such a cut was relatively unlikely. The intervention rate was cut from eight pct on March 10 after being raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 to head off speculative pressure against the franc. Dealers said market fundamentals could justify a further easing, but a combination of technical factors and renewed currency uncertainties surrounding the dollar had put short-term upside pressure on interest rates in recent sessions. Call money rose yesterday to 7-7/8 eight pct from 7-3/4 7/8 pct. Today it was first indicated at 8-1/8 1/4 before easing on news of the tender to 7-13/16 7/8 pct. Technical factors making for a slight shortage of liquidity in the market included the settlement yesterday of the latest monthly treasury tap stock tender, on March 5, market sources said. REUTER 

CURRENCY EXCHANGE LOSS PUSHES MALAYSIA'S DEBT UP

An exchange loss of 7.6 billion ringgit in 1986 pushed Malaysia's outstanding external debt up to 50.99 billion ringgit, from 1985's 42.3 billion, the Central Bank said in its annual report. Bank Negara said although Malaysia's net borrowing dropped in 1986, its external debt rose due to the 30 pct appreciation of the basket of currencies against which the ringgit is pegged. The basket comprises principally the U.S. Dollar, yen, mark, Swiss franc, French franc, sterling, guilder, Canadian and Singapore dollars, it added. Bank Negara said growth in external debt, which declined progressively from a peak of 58 pct in 1982 to 13.6 pct in 1985, rose by 20.2 pct in 1986. Malaysia's debt serving ratio of 17.6 pct of its exports in 1986 is within the prudency limit of 20 pct, Bank Negara Governor Jaafar Hussein told reporters. REUTER 

BANK OF FRANCE BUYS DOLLARS, SELLS YEN - DEALERS

The Bank of France intervened on the market to buy dollars and sell yen to support the U.S. Currency, dealers said. A major French bank said it acted for the central bank in buying between five and 15 mln dlrs against yen. A dealer at another bank said his bank had been asked to publicise the intervention, to send a clear signal to the markets that central banks were acting in concert to maintain the exchange rates agreed to be appropriate at last month's meeting of the Group of Five and Canada in Paris. The dollar was being quoted at 6.0950/70 francs in early afternoon dealings after a fix of 6.09425 francs. The major French bank said it sold yen at a rate of 149.28 against the dollar. The U.S. Currency was subsequently being quoted at 149.25/35. The Bank of Japan was reported in the market overnight to bolster the credibility of the Paris accord following several days of pressure against the dollar. Pressure developed after U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker repeated earlier statements that the Reagan administration had no targets for the dollar, apparently undermining the assumption that the agreement in Paris had fixed broad fluctuation ranges for major currencies. Baker later said his remark had been misinterpreted. REUTER 
DOLLAR/YEN INTERVENTION RESPONDS TO PRESSURE

The Bank of France intervened to buy small amounts of dollars and sell yen in Paris today to stabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month's meeting of Finance Ministers of the Group of Five and Canada, foreign exchange dealers said. But they said recent central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to temporary pressures rather than a major defence operation. A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sources close to the central bank said it had also intervened yesterday. Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with the Bundesbank and Bank of Japan. The sources said the French central bank could have been in the market again today in two-way operations, not necessarily on its own account, but to counter short-term pressures arising from the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31. One major French bank said it bought between five and 15 mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to the dollar. Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of France to say it was in the market, a departure from the central bank's usual insistence on confidentiality. But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention, which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale. "Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you would still be talking of a small overall amount," said one dealer. Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly to have been required to meet year-end window dressing demand for yen. "This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a wider trend," the dealer said. Operators have been extremely cautious about testing the dollar's trading ranges against the West German mark and Japanese yen. These ranges were set in February's stabilisation agreement reached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and the Finance Ministers of Japan, Germany, France, Britain and Canada. But speculative pressures started to build again this week after Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend as repeating earlier statements that Washington had no target for the dollar. Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talking the dollar down, telling a Cable News Network interviewer and a Senate committee he stood by the Paris agreement. Foreign exchange markets had been misreading his comments, he said. REUTER 

ITALIAN 1987 GDP GROWTH FORECAST AT THREE PCT

Italy's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow three pct in real terms this year and 2.7 pct in 1988, said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc (DRI). Michel Girardin, DRI Europe's senior economist, said at a conference that Italian GDP growth this year "will be mainly driven by consumption and especially investment." Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year will shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies. Italy's budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7 pct in real terms in 1986. DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pct in 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interest rates should drop two pct. Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct against the dollar this year following last year's 22 pct appreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against the dollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its value relative to the German currency, he said. DRI estimates that foreign demand for Italian products should grow by a 3.2 pct this year following last year's 6.2 pct increase. REUTER 

BANK OF FRANCE AGAIN BUYING DOLLARS, SOURCES SAY

The Bank of France intervened in the Paris foreign exchange market this morning for the third successive day, banking sources said.

Other dealers also reported small-scale intervention to stabilise the dollar after aggressive selling overnight in Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan also intervened again. The dollar steadied at around 6.0650/0700 francs after easing in early trading to 6.0615/35 from an opening 6.0700/50. It closed yesterday at 6.0800/30. One major french bank said it bought 10 mln dlrs for the central bank, selling yen, within a trading range of 148.20/30 yen to the dollar, compared with yesterday's 149.28 rate at which intervention was carried out here.

 swiss national bank says bought dollars against yen



SWISS NATIONAL BANK SAYS IT BOUGHT DOLLARS

The Swiss National Bank bought dollars against yen today, a spokesman for the bank said. He declined to say how many dollars the bank bought or when precisely it intervened. Swiss foreign exchange dealers described the National Bank's purchases as modest, perhaps amounting to no more than 20 or 30 mln dlrs. The Bank of France, which was reported buying dollars against the yen in Paris, had made inquiries with Swiss banks as well, and the Bundesbank had also intervened. Bank of Japan dollar purchases today were perhaps 1.2 to 1.5 billion dlrs. Dealers said this tended to confirm the market's impression that major industrial countries had agreed at the Paris meeting on an effective floor for the dollar of 148 yen, and the market seemed ready to test it. Commercial clients were also selling dollars against the yen as the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 drew closer. Today's dealings in spot currencies are booked for March 31. One dealer said he had the feeling Japanese companies had been asked by the Bank of Japan not to sell dollars at this point, but some, while sticking to the letter of that request, were offering dollars forward today, rather than lose out if the dollar fell further. The run on the dollar against the yen came in a market thinned by the absence of many dealers for a Forex Club meeting in Hamburg. Trading was, in fact, rather light against currencies other than the yen, the dollar holding little changed through the day. The market now expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to intervene in support of the dollar. "But they will probably do it only half-heartedly, so I don't think it will matter too much on rates," one dealer said. REUTER 

TAIWAN TO STUDY SUSPENDING FOREX CONTROLS

Premier Yu Kuo-Hua ordered financial officials to quicken the pace of relaxing foreign exchange controls and study the possibility of suspending the controls, a cabinet statement said. The statement quoted Yu as telling Finance Ministy and Central Bank officials the relaxation was needed to help reduce Taiwan's surging foreign exchange reserves, which reached a record 53 billion U.S. Dollars this month. Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministry and the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to ease the controls, but he did not give details. Yu said the government could maintain the framework of the foreign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. The controls would be used during emergency. Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its trade surplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion in 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's trade with the United States, according to official figures. But he said that while easing the controls would help reduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in a short time. Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from growing pressure from the United States, Taiwan's largest trading partner, which buys almost half the island's exports. Lu Ming-Jen, economic professor at Soochow University, told Reuters: "The decision came a little bit late. But it was better than never." Ko Fei-Lo, Vice President at First Commercial Bank, said the government should rapidly relax its foreign exchange controls and open its market wider to help balance trade with its trading partners, especially the United States. "The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchange controls will not only help our trading partners, but also help our own economic problems," he said. He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boost Taiwan's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February. REUTER 
OFFICIAL WANTS ARAB FUND TO HELP LEBANESE POUND

Lebanese central bank Vice Governor Meguerditch Bouldikian called for the establishment of an Arab fund to assist the Lebanese pound, which has lost more than 80 pct of its value against the dollar since January 1986. Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference the bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency. But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its war-battered economy now more than ever before. "We expect a common effort between the central bank and Arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed," he said. Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and budget deficits. Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in reducing demand for imports and increasing exports. "These are encouraging factors, but the war has not ended yet," he said. "We believe that with a just political solution acceptable to all sides, confidence will return and this will benefit the Lebanese pound and Lebanon." In the meantime, he said the central bank had four main goals: 1) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit 2) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bank financing institutions in financing the deficit 3) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreign currency deposits 4) to protect the financial health of commercial banks.

CHINA POSTPONES PLAN TO SCRAP PARALLEL CURRENCY

Chinese Vice-Premier Tian Jiyun said plans to scrap the country's parallel currency, Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs), had been postponed due to objections from foreign businessmen and others. But Tian told a news conference the Chinese government still considered FECs unsatisfactory. Asked about the current state of plans to abolish the FECs, Tian said: "We have decided to postpone the question. As to whether it will be done in the future, it will be done according to the evolution of the situation." He said many people, including foreign businessmen, had raised objections to the plan to abolish the certificates, and added: "It is rather complicated." The FECs were introduced in 1980 for use by foreigners in China. But they now circulate widely among local residents and there is a big black market in the currency, though it is theoretically at par with the ordinary Chinese currency, renminbi. Tian said the government still considered that the FECs had "many demerits and negative influences." Bank of China President Wang Deyan told Reuters earlier this month that he thought it unlikely that the certificates would be scrapped this year. Western diplomats and economists have said the Chinese authorities are having trouble finding a suitable alternative. Vice-Premier Yao Yilin announced at a similar press conference last year that the FECs would be abolished, saying the government had decided it was ideologically unacceptable to have two currencies circulating in China at the same time.

ARAB BANKER SAYS TOO SOON FOR SINGLE CURRENCY

Gulf Arab states must coordinate economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers Association said. Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an Arab currency traders meeting: "We have to start with coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go yet." He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a plausible project. The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- have held a series of meetings this year to examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary System (EMS). At present, five currencies are linked either officially or in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies. A common currency system or EMS-style "grid" would, in theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain small. "Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their infancy," he said. Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that often does not recognise the western banking concept of interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.

The statement said the 400,000 lire limit would remain for Italian residents wishing to take cash out of the country, but non-residents could re-export lira cash if they made appropriate declarations at customs points.

BAHRAIN INTRODUCES NEW MONEY MARKET REGIME

Bahrain is introducing a new domestic money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on the island's newly launched treasury bill programme. The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in treasury bills, or through discounting them. The circular, released officially to Reuters, said current arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be valid except "in quite exceptional circumstances." Under the current system, the agency provides the island's 20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term swaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term loans secured against government development bonds. "The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace these operations with short-term assistance based on Government of Bahrain treasury bills," the circular to banks states. The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a higher price which will reflect an interest charge. The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will normally be for a period of seven days. Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of 91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme. Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and have been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered by the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury bills in case they need funds from the central bank. Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold treasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted yields slightly. Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme had started at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct. Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar swaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would foresake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord. REUTER 
INDONESIAN RUPIAH SLIPS AGAINST MARK AND YEN

The Indonesian rupiah has held steady since its 31 pct devaluation against the dollar six months ago, but has slipped against the mark and to a lesser extent against the yen, according to central bank figures. In the past month, the rupiah has fallen five pct against the yen. Today's middle rate per 100 yen was 1,129.78 against 1,075.20 at end-February and 1,058.6 at devaluation in September. Bank Indonesia's quoted rate for the dollar, the main currency for Indonesia's oil and gas exports, was 1,644.0 today, the same rate fixed at the time of devaluation. The rate for the West German mark was 913.28 today, a sharp drop from September when it was 786.06. The British pound has risen to 2,657.93 against 2,429.83. The value of the rupiah is set daily against a basket of currencies by the central bank. The rise in the value of the mark and the yen has hit Indonesia by increasing its debt servicing levels. Its total disbursed foreign debt is estimated by the World Bank at 37 billion dlrs. Japan is one of Indonesia's key trading partners, taking half its oil exports. REUTER 

PHILADELPHIA EXCHANGE TO EXTEND HOURS FOR ASIA

The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets, exchange president Nicholas Giordano said. He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between 1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third quarter this year. The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve clients in the region and educate financial markets about the advantages of currency options, Giordano said. Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the exchange-trade currency option market against existing over-the-counter option trading during the local working day. Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and had grown in popularity, he said. The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs. Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily. Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities, set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries access to a currency option market of much greater depth and liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

BRAZIL TEMPORARILY LEGALISES DLR PARALLEL MARKET

Brazilian President Jose Sarney announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of U.S. dollars in the parallel currency market, aimed at promoting imports of foreign goods. In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face "current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the purchase of goods." The parallel market, although officially tolerated, is technically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above the official rate. Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the parallel market without having to wait for an official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex). Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the economy. The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council (CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's trade policy, with participation of the private sector. The Council had been closed three years ago by the military government of former President Joao Figueiredo. Reuter 

Sarney's decision means that Brazilian importers of machinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the parallel market without having to wait for the issuing of an official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex). Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the economy. The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council (CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's trade policy, with participation of the private sector. The Council had been closed three years ago by the military government of former President Joao Figueiredo. Tomorrow, Brazil was due to fulfill payment of 15 billion dollars in short range credit lines, but its economic officials have suggested a 60-day extension in the deadline in order to seek a renegotiation with its creditors. Sarney told members of the Council that for Brazil it is a must to recover its annual trade balance surplus to the 12 billion dollars average recorded in 1984 and 1985, and which dropped sharply last year to 8 billion dollars. He attributed the poor performance of Brazil's trade balance in 1986 to protectionist moves by industrialised countries, the fall in the prices of basic goods and the crisis faced by several of Brazil's Third World trade partners.

SOUTH KOREA TO RESIST CURRENCY REVALUATION

South Korean Finance Minister Chung In-yong will resist pressure for a currency revaluation to cut South Korea's trade surplus with the United States when he meets Treasury Secretary James Baker next week, Finance Ministry officials said. They said Chung would leave Monday to attend the International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee meeting and to hold talks with Baker and other U.S. officials on ways to reduce the surplus. The April 9 committee meeting is expected to review the agreement by six industrialized nations in Paris last month that newly-industrialized countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, should allow their currencies to increase in value.

DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT EASES IN WEEK

Loans and advances from the Dutch Central Bank to the commercial banks fell 1.01 billion guilders to 9.5 billion guilders in the week ending March 30, the Bank's weekly return showed. Dealers said payments by the Dutch state, partly in the form of civil service wages, had outweighed payments to the State, causing the money market deficit to ease. The Treasury's account with the Bank dropped 960 mln guilders to 6.5 billion guilders. Liabilities in gold or foreign currency rose 200 mln to 11.9 billion guilders. Dealers said it was more likely that the alteration in this item on the weekly return indicated normal commercial foreign exchange business rather than intervention by the Central Bank. The Bank itself does not disclose information on intervention. Seasonal variation brought bank notes in circulation up 190 mln guilders to 29.7 billion guilders. Total gold and currency reserves rose 173 mln guilders to 56.4 billion guilders. Call money and period rates were barely changed in the week. Today all were traded at 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct. REUTER 

The Bank of France is to inject liquidity against first category paper at a tender this afternoon, a Bank spokesman said. Money market sources were divided as to whether they thought the Bank of France would use the occasion to cut its intervention rate, which has stood at 7 3/4 pct since it was cut from eight pct on March 9.

RISING TAIWAN DOLLAR CAUSES FOREIGN RESERVES LOSS

Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July 1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Currency. Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen. The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar today, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since September 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June and to 32 by the end of this year. Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion dlrs. At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world's third largest after West Germany and Japan. Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987. The reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at about 170 leading banks in the U.S., Japan, Britain, Canada and Singapore. About 75 pct of the reserves are in the form of cash, mostly in U.S. Dollars. The rest are in government treasury bills, certificates of deposit and bonds. REUTER 

EYSKENS SAYS US PRIME RISES WILL AID CURRENCIES

Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens warmly welcomed this week's increase in U.S. Prime rates, calling it a move that went beyond the Group of Five and Canada Paris accord on stabilising currencies. The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policy convergence among major countries, he added. In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear he believed the countries involved in the accord - the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - had agreed "tentative" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates. Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Belgium this weekend focusing on the international monetary situation and proposals for strengthening the European Monetary System (EMS). Asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets, Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving "more or less workable" despite what he called evident disagreements over U.S. Economic and monetary policy between Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Besides Baker's public statements that had dramatically influenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.And Japan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against the yen, he said. But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo could reach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. "I think agreement is quite possible," he said. Eyskens said he was "very agreeably surprised" by this week's quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite the obvious negative consequences for debtor countries. "It is a positive element which goes further than the (Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account of its content," he said. He added that coordination of interest rates was a fundamental element of economic and monetary convergence between leading industrialised economies. "A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuation ranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by a more coordinated policy of interest rates," he said. Eyskens made clear he believed the G-6 countries had agreed in Paris on ranges in which to hold their currencies. He said the end of the February 22 Louvre accord, in which the partners agreed to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels, clearly alluded to a "system of tentative (fluctuation) margins." He added the meeting and the statement would have been meaningless if the G-6 had not discussed the technicalities of implementing it. Eyskens said there was growing economic convergence among leading industrialised countries pointing towards greater order in the international monetary system. "That doesn't mean we are ready to restore Bretton Woods (the post-World War Two system of fixed exchange rates), but within the (International Monetary Fund) Interim Committee we are thinking in terms of target zones, fluctuation ranges to be implemented and defended," he said. The Interim Committee meets next week in Washington ahead of the IMF's Spring meetings, and Eyskens said the EC ministers would prepare for the gatherings at this weekend's talks. He said he hoped for wide-ranging talks on the future of the EMS at the weekend meeting, based on proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors for strengthening the system through technical and institutional changes. Eyskens said he expected EC Commission President Jacques Delors to submit proposals for fully liberalising capital movements within the 12-nation bloc and made clear he shared Delors' view that this must be accompanied by a reinforcement of the EMS. "Both are totally linked. Liberalisation without strengthening the EMS would destabilise the Community," he said. REUTER 

NIGERIAN NAIRA FIRMS AFTER RULE CHANGE

The Nigerian naira firmed against the dollar, banking sources said, after the rules governing foreign exchange auctions at the central bank were changed. The marginal rate set at today's auction, from which reporters were barred for the first time since the sessions began last September, was 3.7001 to the dollar compared with 4.0002 at the last session on March 19, the sources said. Under the new system unveiled on March 20 and in operation for the first time today, bidding banks must pay for foreign exchange at the rate they bid, rather than as previously at the rate of the lowest successful bid. The measure was aimed at discouraging banks from bidding high and thus driving down the naira's value. But banking sources and other analysts said demand for foreign exchange remained sharply higher than the available funds. Henceforth the sessions will be held every fortnight, instead of weekly, and today only 80 mln dlrs was on offer compared with the 50 mln dlrs usually on sale each week. The rule change appeared to have an immediate impact on bids. Today's highest bid was 4.06 to the dollar, compared with a top bid of 4.25 two weeks ago. Banks who bid higher than the marginal rate will be able to pass on their rate to their customers, while the marginal rate will only act as a marker for transactions. REUTER 

EC MINISTERS WILL DISCUSS STRENGTHENING EMS FLOAT

European Community finance ministers and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening Europe's joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges. Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who will host the informal talks, told Reuters the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the February agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels. In an interview, Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord between the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada had proved itself "more or less workable." But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the United States and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week. The talks, at the Belgian resort of Knokke, are being held to coordinate the EC's positions on monetary issues and Third World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week. The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow. Continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System, the joint float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, which will feature high on the weekend agenda. Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets, and in particular a more stable dollar, before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings. The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months. In the interview, Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the EC's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors. The committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January. Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit, the fledgling EC currency at the core of the system, to take over the mark's dominant role in the EMS - a proposal that has met with a cool response in West Germany. He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992, such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls. Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in the Community. He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the EC's goal of monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution, instead of by national central banks as at present. Plans for the creation of such an institution, foreseen by the EMS's founding fathers, have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries, notably West Germany, to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field. EMS development has also been held up by Britain's refusal so far to join the system's core exchange rate mechanism. REUTER 

EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS

European Community (EC) finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System (EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said. "There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System, with all that implies," Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort. The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January. The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system. But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS. He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries. They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins. But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors. He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates. The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and monetary integration. "We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system," Eyskens said. Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead. EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties. Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to "dedramatise" realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers. However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves. He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves. He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory. The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul. REUTER 
ZAMBIAN CURRENCY FALLS AT FOREIGN EXCHANGE AUCTION

The Zambian currency further depreciated yesterday at the second auction since the introduction of a two-tier foreign exchange system last month. The (central) Bank of Zambia said the kwacha was pegged at 16.99 to the dollar, compared to last week"s rate of 15 to the dollar. The bank, which offered six mln dlrs at the auction, reported demand for 13.4 mln dlrs. At the previous auction, the government offered eight mln dlrs. Last month the government set a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha per dollar, subject to adjustment against a basket of five currencies, for certain official transactions. It also introduced a new weekly foreign exchange auction only for parastatal organisations and the private sector, where the exchange rate is allowed to float in accordance with market demand. The new auction system is designed to be more restrictive than the previous one, suspended in January after the central bank fell 10 weeks in arrears to successful bidders. Under the new system, no bidder, except the the state oil company Zimoil and the national airline Zambia Airways, is allowed to bid for more than five pct of the foreign exchange on offer. REUTER 

BUNDESBANK ALLOCATES 6.1 BILLION MARKS IN TENDER

The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1 billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said. Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy back securities pledged on May 6. Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with today's allocation. A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful liquidity in the banking system. Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks. The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2 billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity. Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks. The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6 and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that range are possible, dealers said. REUTER 

EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE

European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much. The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it. Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range. "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs. However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday. Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen. A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term. London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside. Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the near term, the traders said. Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend. Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting." Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said "They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said. However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen. Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year. One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar. The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range. A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement." But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability. "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months. A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and should not have produced disappointment. "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade policies to redress current imbalances are of a different timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told Reuters, "This is a political process which takes time." Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on currency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent remedy?" he asked. Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully in the next few weeks for any changes in positions. A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position. Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to support the Paris accord.

European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much. The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it. Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range. "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs. However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday. Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen. A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term. London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside. Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the long term, the traders said. Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend. Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting." Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said "They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said. However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen. Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year. One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar. The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range. A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement." But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability. "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months.

LEBANESE POUND FALLS SHARPLY AGAINST DOLLAR

The Lebanese Pound fell sharply against the U.S. Dollar again today with dealers attributing the decline to continued political uncertainty. The pound closed at 118.25/118.75 against the dollar compared to yesterday's close of 115.60/115.80. "Political deadlock is reflected in the pound's position. There was more demand and less on offer in the market," one dealer told Reuters. The pound, which was at 18 to the dollar in January, 1986, has lost more than 30 pct of its international value over the past three months. REUTER 

KENYA DEVALUES SHILLING BY 0.6 PCT AGAINST SDR

Kenya devalued the shilling by 0.6 pct against the special drawing right (SDR) in response to the decline of the dollar last last week, bankers said. The Central Bank of Kenya set the shilling at 20.7449 to the SDR compared with the 20.6226 rate in force since the last devaluation on March 31. The Kenyan shilling has lost 5.6 pct of its value against the SDR this year in a series of devaluations designed to keep the value of the dollar above 16 shillings. REUTER 
SAUDI RIYAL DEPOSITS SURGE ON U.S. RATE RISE

Saudi riyal interbank deposit rates surged across the board as banks tried to build long positions in anticipation of a further rise in U.S. Interest rates, dealers said. They said traders expected riyal deposits to follow the recent strong rise in eurodollar rates sparked by fears of a tighter U.S. Monetary policy to halt the dollar's slide. "There was a wave of panic buying early in the morning as people tried to cover gaps and build long riyal positions," said one dealer. As a result, riyal deposits were strongly bid and traders scrambled for any available offers. One-way trade focused mainly on the fixed periods but short dates also rose, dealers said. Spot-next and one-week deposits climbed to 6-5/8, 1/8 pct from 6-3/8, six on Sunday. One-month deposits rose to 6-1/2, 3/8 pct from 6-1/4, six and three-month deposits climbed to 6-3/4, 5/8 pct from 6-9/16, 7/16. Six-month deposits also firmed to 7-1/8, seven pct from 7-1/16, 6-7/8 on Sunday. The spot riyal was steady at 3.7500/03 to the dollar after quotes of 3.7498/7503 yesterday. REUTER 

ZAMBIA'S KWACHA FALLS AT WEEKLY AUCTION

The Zambian kwacha fell at this week's foreign exchange auction to 18.75 kwacha to the dollar from last week's 16.95, the Bank of Zambia said. The rate was the lowest since the auctions resumed two weeks ago under a new two-tier exchange rate system worked out with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The Bank of Zambia said it received 370 bids, ranging from 13.00 to 20.75 kwacha, for the six mln dlrs on offer. One hundred and thirty-five bids were successful. A British High Commission spokesman said Britain would put eight mln stg into the auction at a rate of one mln a week as soon as Zambia reached a full agreement with the IMF. The money could be spent only on goods produced and supplied by British firms, excluding luxuries and defence equipment, the spokesman added. Reuter 
WORLD BANK SUGGESTS MORE OPEN ECONOMY FOR INDIA

The World Bank has suggested India should move to a more open economy by gradually removing most government controls on industry and adopting a liberal external trade policy with reduced levels of protection. A confidential "executive summary" of a draft Bank report on the Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggests liberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports of Indian goods by making them more competitive. The summary said, "These reforms would result in (domestic) prices much more in line with world prices than is true today, and in a greater degree of import competition and export rivalry than the nation has ever seen." The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in India's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberal imports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and expose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exports would provide the foreign exchange for imports. "The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present principle of unlimited protection for all indigenously available products and to recognise the role of actual or potential competition from imports as a source of discipline on the prices and costs of public and private sector domestic manufacturers," the summary said. An Indian official told Reuters the government was discussing the report with the Bank. A final report with some changes was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to give further details. The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank's final report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discuss aid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June. The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grew at an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and 1986/87, which ended in March. It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of gdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by national savings, mainly from the private sector. India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed to 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86. But the summary said the improvement was largely due to lower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertilisers which make up the bulk of India's import bill. India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign exchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, the summary said. The Bank's summary said there was little room for complacency in the balance of payments position. It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87, Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs. Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a year in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable balance of payments, the summary said. It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued. India "might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while undertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that involve some political costs," it said. "An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an exchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability," the summary said. It said such an approach had been successful in countries such as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain the competitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduce import pressures. Earlier this year, the Indian government denied that the World Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boost exports. REUTER 
BELGIUM CUTS TREASURY CERTIFICATE RATES

The Belgian National Bank said it cut its one, two and three month treasury certificate rates effective immediately. It said in a telex message the key three month rate was reduced by 0.05 points to 7.25 pct, the two month rate by 0.10 points to 7.20 pct and the one month rate by 0.15 points to 7.15 pct. The Bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificate rates on April 3, when all three rates were cut by 0.10 points. It has made regular small reductions in rates after hoisting the three month rate 0.50 points to 7.90 pct and the other rates to eight pct on January 6 ahead of the realignment of the European Monetary System. The National Bank bought more than 7.91 billion francs of foreign currency in the week ended April 13, a National Bank spokesman said last week. Foreign exchange analysts noted this reflects the current strength of the Belgian franc. REUTER 

CREATIVE MONETARY POLICY TO SPUR KUWAITI ECONOMY

Kuwait, a major oil producer hit by last year's price slump, is leaning towards a more creative monetary policy to help spur its economy, banking sources said. "There is a clear emphasis on encouraging the use of money in productive ventures, rather than having it all tied up in interest bearing investments which have no direct productive outlet," one banker said. Kuwait's Central Bank yesterday cut one key money market rate and abandoned another which had been used since February 1986 to direct inter-bank borrowing and lending costs. The bank reduced to six pct from 6-1/2 pct the rate at which it will offer funds of one month to one year in the inter-bank market. This, in turn, affected retail rates. The cut, the third this year, followed a major overhaul of interest rate policy last month which Central Bank Governor Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah said was designed to revive the economy. One banker said "There is growing flexibility, creativity, in interest rate policy, amid an awareness of the need to diversify the economy by stimulating the non-oil sector." For the first time in nearly three years domestic interest rates are now significantly below those for the U.S. Dollar, a favourite haven for Gulf speculative and investor funds in the past, banking sources said. Despite uncertainties generated by the 6-1/2 year old Iran- Iraq war on Kuwait's northern doorstep, bankers play down the prospect of any significant capital flight. The Kuwaiti dinar, whose value is set by the Central Bank and was fixed today at 0.27095/129 to the dollar, is stronger now than for several years. Fears that the dollar may fall further will prompt second thoughts among Kuwaiti investors prepared to consider switching funds into the U.S. Currency, the sources said. "There is a distinct exchange rate risk," they added. Bankers said the dollar slump hurt many investors behind the last major capital outflow in 1984, encouraged then by 18 pct U.S. Interest rates and the start of Iranian attacks on neutral shipping in the Gulf. The Central Bank calculates its dinar exchange rate against a basket of currencies. Bankers do not know the basket's exact make-up but say it is weighted heavily in favour of the dollar. Some bankers believe any strengthening of the dinar beyond 0.27000 to the dollar might provoke investors into shifting funds into the U.S. Currency. "They may ask:When will the dollar be so cheap again?" one said. And with dinar interest rates now roughly one pct below those for the dollar, they say the Central Bank faces a delicate balancing role requiring further flexibility. Bankers said the current, expansionary interest rate policy is only part of a broader attempt to encourage local investment and strengthen the backbone of the economy. They estimate the economy, measured in terms of GDP and allowing for inflation, shrank 19 pct in 1986 after an 8.1 pct contraction the previous year. Bankers also noted recent measures to stimulate stock market activity, capped today by sharp cuts in brokerage fees to make it cheaper for investors to trade. REUTER 

The Bank of Japan intervened just after the Tokyo market opened to support the dollar from falling below 140.00 yen, dealers said.

The dollar opened at a record Tokyo low of 140.00 yen against 140.70/80 in New York and 141.15 at the close here yesterday. The previous Tokyo low was 140.55 yen set on April 15. REUTER 
SWISS COMMITTED TO JOINT CURRENCY INTERVENTION

The Swiss National Bank will continue to take part in concerted intervention on currency markets as necessary, president Pierre Languetin told the bank's annual meeting. He said the dollar had on occasion hit highs or lows which bore no relation to economic fundamentals and cooperation between all monetary authorities was necessary to prevent it breaching thresholds that would damage everyone. "We are resolved -- as we have done in the past -- to take part in concerted intervention to the extent that this is possible and desirable," Languetin said. Languetin said Switzerland had noted with satisfaction the six nation Paris accord on currency stabilisation measures in February, adding that it had anchored the principle of strengthened international cooperation. He said measures such as recent concerted intervention were useful in the short term. But he added, "The (Paris) Louvre accord can produce no lasting effects without a correction of the fundamental imbalances, without a reduction of the American budget deficit and without stronger growth in Europe and Japan." Languetin said certain changes would probably be necessary in the "too expansive" monetary policy of the United States, adding that there was a prevailing view that U.S. Money supply was expanding too strongly. "If this should last long the dollar could only be stabilised at the cost of a substantial easing in monetary policy on the part of the other central banks, which would in turn create the basis for a new wave of world-wide inflation," he said. One positive factor was that monetary authorities in the most important countries had not relinquished their anti-inflation policies. REUTER 

UGANDAN GOVERNMENT PROPOSES NEW TAXES

The Ugandan government, in its four year investment and development plan, proposed taxing land and food crops in an attempt to broaden its revenue base away from dependence on coffee sales. The government also said in the plan, made available to Reuters, that a devaluation of the Ugandan shilling would do little to redress a chronic balance of payments deficit. The plan, the first since President Yoweri Museveni took power 15 months ago, seeks to raise 2.4 billion dlrs in investment funds from abroad between 1987 and 1991. It says the government had already secured 1.4 billion dlrs in pledges before Islamic lenders promised a further 494 mln dlrs at a conference in Kampala last week. Uganda already had an external debt of 984 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 and in the nine months of the current budget debt servicing will cost 204 mln dlrs, almost 50 pct of export earnings of 431 mln, the plan said. The new fiscal measures include a proposed tax on large land holdings, regardless of whether the owners are exploiting them, and taxes on maize, beans and other crops sold by the Produce Marketing Board. The plan says the aim is to spread the tax burden, which in Uganda has traditionally fallen almost exclusively on coffee farmers. Coffee provides over 90 pct of foreign exchange earnings and more than 70 pct of government revenue. On exchange rate policy, it repeats Museveni's argument that any form of fotation would not help allocating resources. Western governments and multilateral funds say the Ugandan shilling is grossly overvalued and the government must change the exchange rate if it wishes to encourage investment. The shilling sells on the black market at more than 15,000 to the dollar, compared with an official rate of 1,400. REUTER 
BANK OF FINLAND EASES REFERENCE RATE RESTRICTIONS

The Bank of Finland said it was reducing restrictions on the use of money market rates as reference rates for loans. The Bank would start quoting money market rates referred to as HELIBOR (Helsinki Interbank Offered Rate). Banks may henceforth use these as reference rates in their lending, it said. From May 1 the banks would be allowed, without special central bank approval, to use as a reference rate not only its base rate but also other Bank of Finland rates or the official money market rate used in market transactions. A derivative of these could also be used, the statement said. But housing loans would be excepted and their lending rate would, as formerly, be linked directly or indirectly to the Bank of Finland's base rate. The new guidelines involve mainly two changes. Money market rates in future would be used as reference rates for loans with a maturity of over five years and the introduction of a new reference rate would no longer require central bank approval. The decision was made as a continuation of the central bank's process of liberalisation, it said. REUTER 
UAE TO COORDINATE EXCHANGE RATES WITH GCC

United Arab Emirates (UAE) Central Bank Governor Abdel Malik al-Hamar said any changes in the UAE"s exchange rate policy would be carried out in conjunction with other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. In a speech opening a seminar on Arab exchange rate policies, he noted the UAE had not changed the value of the dirham against the U.S. Dollar since 1980 despite wide fluctuations in the latter"s value against other currencies. "The exchange rate policy of the dirham has realised its goals in the past and changes in this policy depend on coordination and cooperation with other GCC countries," he said. The GCC states -- the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait -- have agreed in principle to link their currencies to a common grid. Their currencies are now linked either to the dollar, IMF special drawing right (SDR) or, in the case of Kuwait, a trade-weighted basket of international currencies. The UAE dirham can fluctuate within a band of 7.25 pct higher or lower than 4.7619 to the SDR but has been fixed at 3.671 to the dollar since November 1980. REUTER 

BALLADUR URGES ADHERENCE TO G-7 CURRENCY ACCORDS

French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the Group of Seven major industrial nations, G-7, can achieve stable currency values by adhering to accords reached this year in Paris and Washington. Balladur, asked at a news conference if coordinated market intervention by central banks was sufficient to halt the dollar's recent slide, said "each country has to fulfill commitments" outlined in the G-7 accords. Earlier this month in Washington, finance ministers of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada reaffirmed an earlier Paris accord to arrest the dollar's fall. Balladur said the current nervousness in foreign exchange markets can be partly attributed to "some operators in the market only watching short term economic indicators. You have to keep a cool head," he said, declining to elaborate further. In an earlier speech before the Milan Chamber of Commerce, the minister said European countries have to seek "a better consensus of economic and monetary policies." On the European Monetary System, he said, "The persistent vulnerability of the foreign currency mechanism, particularly to the movements of the dollar, can be explained by the absence of a common policy for currencies of other countries." Balladur said, "I am profoundly convinced that the European countries have to define together this position with respect to the dollar and the yen." He said Italy eventually would have to abandon its higher margin of fluctuation within the European Montetary System. "I hope that the spectacular improvement of the economic situation and of the balance of payments will permit (Italy) to do it soon." The lira is currently allowed a fluctuation margin either side of its agreed midpoints with other EMS currencies of six pct, against 2.25 pct permitted for the other members. REUTER 

TAIWAN CENTRAL BANK DEFENDS DOLLAR RESERVES POLICY

Central Bank governor Chang Chi-cheng defended Taiwan's policy of holding a large amount of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Dollars, citing similar policies followed by countries such as West Germany and Japan. The reserves, now a record 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, are the world's largest after those of West Germany and Japan. About 90 pct is held in U.S. Dollars and the rest in yen and marks. Chang's remarks to parliament were in response to a call on Monday by about 20 members of the parliament who asked the government to diversify into other currencies, including yen, marks and Swiss francs because of exchange rate losses. The legislators said the bank lost about 3.8 billion U.S. Dlrs between September 1985 and September 1986 as the Taiwan dollar rose to 36.77 to the U.S. Dollar from 40.45. They said they expected the losses to continue because of the rising Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Currency. Chang said the central bank could not sell the U.S. Dollars like other private banks or enterprises because such trading would be speculative and risky. "The U.S. Dollar is an international currency and is widely used among trading nations," he added. Chang said the Central Bank has further revised foreign exchange rules, which would relax most controls or even suspend them. The revised rules have been submitted to the cabinet for approval, he said. He declined to give details. REUTER 
SWISS PREPARED TO INCREASE CURRENCY INTERVENTION

The Swiss National Bank is prepared to increase its intervention on currency markets if the action can be properly coordinated with other central banks, Markus Lusser, a member of the Bank's three man directorate, said. He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that intervention to support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes in exchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes in economic policy. However, intervention could send signals that would contribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements. The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperation with other central banks, especially where convincing coordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lusser said. He said currency developments could not simply be talked into existence but needed to be matched by actions in the field of economic policy. "Put simply, that means that in order to stabilise the dollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit and a slowdown in money supply growth in the United States are unavoidable," he said. The National Bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedly in the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it had intervened in dollar-Swiss franc for the first time since last October. Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stability lay not in currency intervention by central banks but only in an improvement in international economic policy coordination. This meant that industrial countries must avoid abrupt switches in economic policy and give priority to price stability. Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the view that easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatible with its primary goal of combatting inflation. The bank target is for growth of two pct in central bank money supply in 1987. He noted that in 1978, when the Swiss franc rose sharply against all currencies, the bank was forced to abandon its money supply targets in favour of an exchange rate target, with the result that inflation surged. "Current exchange rate developments have not, until today at any rate, made any such measures by the National Bank necessary," he said. REUTER 

EGYPT FUEL PRICE INCREASES PART OF REFORM PACKAGE

Egypt has embarked on reforms sought by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank by raising the price of diesel oil and other types of transport fuels. The energy price increases were the first visible measures taken in return for IMF standby credits and World Bank loans. Effective today, fuel oil prices were trebled and prices of gas oil, diesel and kerosene went up by over 50 pct, an Egyptian General Petroleum Corp (EGPC) official said. He said fuel oil will sell for 28 Egyptian pounds a ton, instead of 7.5 pounds. Kerosene and gas oil were raised by 66 pct to sell for five piasters a litre, while diesel rose 50 pct to 4.5 piasters. The government is expected also to act soon, possibly as early as next weekend, to simplify the country's complex exchange rate system, bankers said. Moving towards a more realistic exchange rate for the pound was part of a package of reforms sought by the IMF and creditor governments. In return, Egypt stands to receive up to one billion dlrs in IMF standby credits phased over three years to help it repay its 38.6 billion dlr foreign debt and guarantee rescheduling by western governments, the main creditors. Energy price increases were also a condition of progress on World Bank project loans of up to 800 mln dlrs in energy, communications and other sectors which have been under negotiation for several months, western diplomats said. The U.S. And Western Europe have pledged political backing for President Hosni Mubarak's government, committed to a multi-party political system and peace with Israel and strategically poised in control of the Suez Canal. Fuel price rises, postponed at least once and likely to lead to higher retail prices of basic goods, were a test of the government's resolve to pursue economic reform, diplomats said. But the new prices are still below world market levels. There was no announcement of increases in more politically sensitive products such as gasoline or natural gas, used for cooking, and the mass-circulation Al-Akhbar newspaper said they would stay the same. Official comment was not available on speculation among bankers and diplomats that the Central Bank would soon tinker with the pound's exchange rates to try to channel more dollars into the banking system away from the illegal but tolerated free market. The Central Bank was expected to set up a committee in which 10 commercial banks, including the four state-owned banks, would decide the pound's value every day. The official "incentive rate," currently set by the Central Bank daily, is around 1.36 pounds to the dollar, against 2.15 on the free market. Bankers predicted that the banks' committee might set rates around 1.80 or 1.90. But some doubted this would serve the aim of curbing the free market. REUTER 

VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS

Venezuela's central bank has ordered Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange operations with brokers based outside the country, according to a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters. The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's volatile currency market. The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international operations. The telex said the restriction on business with foreign brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela. In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to prop up the weakening bolivar. But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de facto currency control. "It is definitely a control in the sense that there's no longer complete freedom to operate," one broker here said. "Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction is towards complete control," the broker said. The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with telephone calls. He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs a day. "It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active," he said. The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks. "We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's ridiculous," he said. "They've been on a rampage against foreigners." The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct reserve requirement. In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in bolivar futures, the broker said. "We used to have a forward market," he said. "For a small currency it was miraculous." He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S. Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free market.

TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE

Taiwan's central bank announced that as from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at the end of May. The central bank's statement added that the measure would be effective until the end of July. Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend foreign exchange to importers and exporters. Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April, according to official statistics. Last week the central bank said that from today it would reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move was needed because of "distortions" in the foreign exchange market. Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar, have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank market to avoid exchange rate losses. Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9 billion in April. All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation. In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money. Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S.. Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about 22 pct against the U.S. Dollar. Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will be dropped by the end of July or early August. Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs. Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to close at 1,803.08. REUTER 
KUWAITI DINAR RATES FIRM, AID WINDOW OPEN

Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar deposits held firm in scattered trading despite a Central Bank decision to revive limited funding lines, dealers said. The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily aid window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened the facility for three month money, which was available at seven pct, they said. It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap facilities, dealers said. Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of dollars by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency arising from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension, dealers said. However, as one dealer noted: "The market is still unsettled." Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business, traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers down to 10 pct by the close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight. Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early 9-1/2, 7-1/2. One month rates were at the same level after trade at eight then 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct and six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reported offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close. The Central Bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at 0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73. The spot dinar was 0.27930/40. REUTER 

LEUTWILER WANTS FIRMER MARK AGAINST SFR

Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank president, urged the National Bank to declare its intent of achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc. In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, "A gradually rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with regard to sustaining Swiss industry." "Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect," he said. Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central bank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank's target of monetary stability. "Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary policy," he told shareholders. "Realistically there is in fact no persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20 pct lower than the Swiss." A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a long period of time. The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market, not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence individual parities separately. Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy. "I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a stronger dollar lies in the United States itself," Leutwiler said. REUTER 

TAIWAN PARLIAMENT BACKS FREE CAPITAL OUTFLOWS

Parliament approved a proposal to drop all controls on capital outflows, raising the prospect that Taiwan's vast resevoir of foreign exchange will flow into the world economy. A government spokesman said the new law would be promulgated by President Chiang Ching-Kuo within 10 days and financial authorities would then be empowered to lift controls on currency outflows at any time. Tight restrictions on capital inflows introduced this year will remain in place, the spokesman said. Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-Cheng has said the controls will be lifted at the end of next month or early in August. The central bank and finance ministry proposed lifting currency restrictions to help reduce Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, which stand at about 60 billion U.S. Dlrs and have led to runaway growth in money supply. The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and West Germany, also draw attention to Taiwan's huge trade surplus and the government fears they are making the island a target for U.S. Trade protectionism. The surplus rose 34 pct to a record 7.32 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first five months of this year and about 90 pct of it was with the United States. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.9 pct in the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation. Local bankers and economists say when the controls are lifted, businessmen will be allowed to buy foreign currency and invest it freely overseas. But they warn against expectations of a sudden outflow of capital. "I don't think we're going to see a big bang," John Brinsden, the Taiwan manager of Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters in a recent interview. Bankers said that businessmen have been holding vast quantities of foreign exchange overseas for many years and also have been freely buying and exporting currency through a flourishing black-market. "Obviously there will be an outflow of funds ... But I don't think it's going to be much," said Danny Chan, director of Fidelity Securities Investment Consulting Corp. Economists say the success of plans to encourage capital outflow depend on whether the central bank can slow the rise of the local currency. The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 23 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1983, prompting an inflow of speculative money. It rose by one Taiwan cent today to close at 31.08. The government spokesman said the new law does not empower authorities to permanently lift capital controls, but any proposal to reimpose them would need the approval of parliament. Many economists believe that once the controls are lifted it will be almost impossible to reimpose them. REUTER 
NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE

Analysts said they were surprised at the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy statements and positive for the economy. Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs against a 1.95 billion deficit last year. Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts' forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets. Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a 2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus. The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically, the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more confident about investing in New Zealand, he said. However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower. The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget release. Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market, despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures. One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by 50 points tomorrow. The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a continuation of existing policies, and the absence of traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors, another said. But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market, particularly multi-national companies. The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements, through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion. Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely credible. "Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects," he said. An election is due before the end of September. REUTER 

TAIWAN DOLLAR AND RESERVES SEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY

Recent government moves to curb capital inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said. Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the U.S. Dollar. Chang said, "The pace of increase in our reserves is much slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable." He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S. Dlrs a month between January and May. The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs. On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90 pct of the value of a contract. Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to importers and exporters. They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks registering a fall of up to 30 pct. Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five to eight cents in May. The bank dealers said the central bank, which had previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1 billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial demand. They said they expected the government to keep the local dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since September 1985. The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today, unchanged from yesterday. Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said, "It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow is quite successful." Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan. Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed imports of machinery and production equipment because of exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate would help boost imports, particularly from the United States. REUTER 

VENEZUELA PROBES ALLEGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE FRAUD

Banking authorities and police are investigating an alleged fraud by the second largest trading house in the Caracas free foreign exchange market, Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters. The Superintendency of Banks and the Technical and Judicial Police have both begun probes of Cambio la Guiara, Azpurua said on Friday night. Police said the owners of the firm, Mario Muggia and his brother Luigi Muggia, have left Venezuela. Cambio la Guiara operated in part on the "parallel market" in which traders buy and sell dollars among themselves. The Venezuelan central bank on June 17 suspended the licences of all 21 foreign exchange operators in the parallel market, blaming their speculation for the constant rise in the value of the U.S. Dollar here. Juan Domingo Cordero, vice-president of the Caracas Stock Exchange and the owner of a foreign exchange trading house, said on Friday he had begun legal action against Cambio la Guiara for issuing him four checks without funds for a total amount of almost one mln dlrs. The Cambio la Guiara exchange house had operated in Venezuela for more than 20 years. REUTER 

NORWAY CENTRAL BANK SELLS CROWNS TO EASE PRESSURE

Norway's central bank sold crowns in the open market in a bid to ease strong upward pressure on the currency, which threatens to rise above set levels in a basket of currencies, dealers said. The central bank declined comment, but dealers noted the bank had also intervened and sold small amounts of crowns on Friday. The bank is committed to defending the crown at certain levels in a basket of 14 trade-weighted currencies. "They've been in again this morning, selling piecemeal whenever they think necessary," a senior dealer at an Oslo bank, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. The crown's index is currently around 109.60 in the basket -- close to its upper limit of 109.50 which the central bank is committed to defending. A low index figure indicates a high value for the crown. The limit at the other end of the scale is set at 114.50. The crown has been bolstered by high Norwegian interest rates, currently around 16 pct in the money market, and better than expected economic indicators which showed a sharply reduced foreign trade deficit in May and inflation stabilising around the current annual rate of 10 pct.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said there was no evidence to suggest the fall in share prices had affected financial stability and it would maintain its firm monetary policy. Governor Spencer Russell said in a statement the central bank did not accept arguments that the battle against inflation should now take a low second priority after the sharemarket's plunge. Russell said the bank had two statutory responsibilities -- to implement the government's monetary policy to bring down inflation, and to ensure the financial sector's stability. "Unless the bank is directed otherwise, the firm monetary policy will continue because it is very much in the national interest that it do so," he said. "And there is yet no evidence available to the bank to suggest that the fall in share prices has affected the stability of the financial sector."

French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major industrial countries.

The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged dollar slide. The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Washington last month. But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate rise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to." "What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow them," he added.

ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR

An income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said. Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies. The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech. He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast. Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was probably unavoidable, Bayliss said. He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986, but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact. Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation. The government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added. New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June. The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit. "The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based -- primarily because the government's macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful," Bayliss said.

KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS

Kuwait"s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices. Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: "None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting." He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd. "This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so," the minister said. Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd. "If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever," he said. He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel. Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel. Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices." Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate. However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added. He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body"s members. Ecuador"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec"s pricing committee. Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: "We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April." But he expected the situation would later improve. REUTER 

QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88

The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices, announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals. The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86. In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period. Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion. The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct. He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves. He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture. No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue. Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."

SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC PACT

Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said. Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance." Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market." Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs. Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market. He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord. In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement. "We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions," he said. Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices. Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling. They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing. REUTER 
SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD

Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said. They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers. But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said. The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes. Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end. Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said. The four -- Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Texaco Inc <TX> and Chevron Corp <CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel. However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels. Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices. The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries. They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each.

GREECE SAYS IT HAS RIGHT ON AEGEAN OIL DRILLING

Greece, responding to a warning by Turkey against conducting oil activities in the Aegean Sea, said today it had the right to decide where and how to do research or drilling work in the area. A government spokesman said the Greek position was made clear to Turkey's ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Yannis Kapsis last week. Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976 Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens. The Greek statement today said, "Greece is not prepared to give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed. It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government." "The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive through the fault of Turkey," it said. The Greek statement said Athens was ready to put the continental shelf issue before international courts. Reuter 
OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING, SUBROTO SAYS

Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil. Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said. He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied: "Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate. He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties. He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting. He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters." Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together.

KENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS

The Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985, he added. "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year," he said. The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history, he added. "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development," he said. "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added. REUTER 

The Papua New Guinea Government will establish a public corporation to invest in resources projects, Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said. "We intend to provide a means through which less privileged individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the development of mining and petroleum projects," he told Parliament. Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects would be maintained, he said. The planned agency could take over the state's equity in current developments. Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects. "The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases in an orderly way," he said.

OPEC SAYS FEBRUARY OUTPUT UNDER CEILING

OPEC output in February was "well below" the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying. The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result "of member countries' firm determination to defend the organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price." The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25. The official gave no figure for February output. The statement said only that "the reduction in total supplies, namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month." "No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price, member countries are, without exception, strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail," the statement said. "The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price," the statement said. Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact. There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets. The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled "because of member countries' firm determination to defend the price (system)" agreed in December. Opec"s differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no new date set, according to an official of the United Arab Emirates, which chairs the seven-state body.

IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD

OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter 1986, the International Energy Agency said. A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report. These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to fixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for fixed volumes over an extended period. It gave this breakdown for OPEC crude output, in mln bpd FOURTH QTR 1986 JANUARY 1987 FEBRUARY 1987 SAUDI ARABIA 4.9 3.7 3.8 IRAN 1.6 2.2 1.9 IRAQ 1.6 1.6 1.7 UAE 1.3 1.2 1.2 KUWAIT 1.0 1.0 1.0 NEUTRAL ZONE 0.5 0.4 0.4 QATAR 0.3 0.3 0.2 NIGERIA 1.3 1.2 1.2 LIBYA 1.0 1.0 1.0 FOURTH QTR 1986 JANUARY 1987 FEBRUARY 1987 ALGERIA 0.6 0.6 0.6 GABON 0.1 0.2 0.2 VENEZUELA 1.6 1.6 1.6 ECUADOR 0.2 0.2 0.2 INDONESIA 1.3 1.2 1.2 TOTAL 17.3 16.5 16.1 The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota of 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to Norbec stock disposals. Contracts for Saudi crude have been signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings. The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut February production. It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd. The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter. The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains. Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record 1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected in February in accordance with government curtailments of approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.

Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a month to repair Ecuador's main pipeline linking Amazon basin oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast. The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point Mercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred near the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito. Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.

ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL

The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said. The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks. The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank. However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said.

However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build. Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports. It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America. In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline. Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said. A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

ECUADOR QUAKE TO CUT OIL REVENUES 800 MLN DLRS

up to 300 people were feared dead and more than 15,000 people left homeless by thursday's earthquake, which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleum revenues, authorities said. They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline at 150 mln dlrs. "the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is gigantic," president leon febres cordero said after inspecting the damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 miles from here. The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the presidential press office. The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific ocean port. Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of ecuador's exports. the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo province, health minister jorge brancho told reuters. "we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is no way of now knowing the exact figure because many people have disappeared," he said. Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead. So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said. Information Minister Marco Lara told reporters: "the number of dead and injured is not known ... because we do not know how many people lived in the homes hit by the landslides." Bracho said at least 15,000 were left homeless in the cayambe district. Reuter 

IRANIAN OIL MINISTER IN UAE TALKS

Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh is in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to discuss oil prices and the general market situation, Iranian officials accompanying him said. He will meet UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan and Oil Minister Mana Said al-Oteiba. Aqazadeh arrived last night after a brief stopover in Riyadh, where he met Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazir. The official Saudi Press Agency quoted him as saying his talks at Riyadh with Nazir had been constructive and good. Aqazadeh said Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members were agreed on holding production stable and he reiterated the importance of maintaining oil prices. OPEC members agreed in December to limit production to 15.8 mln barrels per day for the first half of this year and on a benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Aqazadeh also visted OPEC members Gabon, Algeria and Libya. The Iranian news agency, IRNA, quoted him as saying before leaving Tripoli that OPEC should do everything possible to make oil prices permanently stable. REUTER 
SAUDI ARABIA'S KING FAHD WANTS STABLE OIL PRICES

King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group. His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month. King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December. The King replied: "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability." Non-OPEC countries "must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone," he said. Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark. In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure, due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987. A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the group's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output. The King also urged the world community to help the Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be resolved on the battlefield, he said. REUTER 
OIL FIRMS CUT 1987 INDONESIAN EXPLORATION SPENDING

Foreign oil companies will spend less on exploration in Indonesia this year than last, budgeting 2.7 billion dlrs for calendar 1987 against 1986 spending of 2.8 billion dlrs, the state oil company Pertamina said. Actual spending last year fell short of the budgeted figure of 3.2 billion dlrs, as oil companies slashed expenditure because of the crash in world oil prices. Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina's coordinating board for foreign contractors, said foreign companies will drill 110 exploration wells and 431 development wells this year, against 108 and 330 last year.

Negotiations between Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina and foreign oil contractors on extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract will be concluded by the end of this month, a Pertamina official said. Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina's foreign contractors coordinating board, gave no details about the outcome of the talks. But Pertamina President Abdul Rachman Ramly has said priority will be given to extending contracts for companies whose exploration and production contracts expire within the next seven to 10 years. Jukardi, speaking to Indonesian reporters, said the negotiations would determine whether the 85-15 production sharing split in favour of Pertamina would be adhered to or altered in some cases as oil companies are asking for. Hardjoko Seputro, spokesman for the Mines and Energy Ministry, has said that President Suharto has agreed in principle to extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract to reflect better current depressed conditions on the international oil market.

ECUADOR CRUDE OIL EXPORTS STOPPED FOR FIVE MONTHS

Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week"s earthquake, which will stop crude exports for five months, energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said. Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc <TX.N> and a Mexican and an Argentine firm. President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports for four months due to the quake. Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of Ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues. Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a 180-day period. He added the Caracas-based Andean Development Corp had granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline, 50 km of which had been damaged in the quake. In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterday summoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issued appeal for emergency aid for the country. Only three countries, the U.S., Colombia and Venezuela, had offered assistance. REUTER 
OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING

OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said. He told a news conference here "After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices." Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned. "We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February," Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level. "The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs," Lukman said. He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said. "If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs," the group's president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely. "Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to," he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied "We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials." Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude. "We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year," Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market. "We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly," he said. Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster.

ECUADOR DEPUTY MINISTER SEEKS OIL AID IN VENEZUELA

Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry following last week's earthquake, officials said. Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports. Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after 180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs. The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota, set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987. "All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production," a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said. Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired, officials said. Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level, officials said. Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador's Far Eastern clients. But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made in due course. Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired. Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake. REUTER 

BRAZIL'S SARNEY MEETS STRIKES WITH SHOW OF FORCE

With troops in place in Brazil's ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of force. Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and six areas of oil production. The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry employees. The government had already dispatched more than 1,000 marines to occupy the country's main ports after a national seamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday. The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day, represents a stern challenge to the government. The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil desperately needs foreign exchange. It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance which precipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen's strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most important in South America -- and the country's other main ports. Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military presence here is generally discreet. A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are out of sight. Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the Docemarte, seamen's leaders said. After explaining to the captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because the strike was illegal, the men returned to work. One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said "it is a psychological war. They are using force and we are using peaceful methods." Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working. At the seamen's national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports. Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board ships here were not running out of food. The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney's civilian government since it came to power two years ago. Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank interest rates. The current rash of labour unrest in industry and agriculture stems from the failure of the government's now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze. Reuter 

VENEZUELA TO LEND OIL TO ECUADOR FOR EXPORT

venezuela will supply ecuador with an as yet undetermined amount of crude oil to help it meet export commitments, seriously affected by last week's earthquake, energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti said. He gave few details about the deal, but said a crude oil loan agreement will be made between state oil companies petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa) and ecuador's cepe. Ecuador was forced to suspend oil exports for an expected four months after an earthquake damaged a pipeline. Oil accounts for 60 per cent of its export income. Hernandez was speaking to reporters at miraflores palace on the results of talks with ecuador's deputy energy minister fernando santos alvite, who arrived here last night. "the volume lent to ecuador would be discounted from its opec quota and would not affect venezuela's," he said. "we would from august on produce our own quota and sell the additional amounts that ecuador would be repaying us," he said. He did not elaborate on the quota arrangements but did say ecuador would notify opec by telex that venezuela would be lending it a certain amount over so many days. Venezuela's opec output quota is currently 1.495 million barrels a day, and ecuador's has been set at 210,000 bpd. Reuter 

Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to compensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake, deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said. Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached. The additional output would be related to plans now under discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake. Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified part of Ecuador's export commitments. But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of 300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico might supply Ecuador's South Korean market. Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao. REUTER 

SAUDI OUTPUT SAID AT YEAR LOW TO HELP OPEC

Saudi Arabian oil output has fallen to its lowest level in more than a year, giving fresh evidence of the kingdom's determination to keep oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel, as agreed by Opec last December, oil industry sources said. They said Saudi output in the first eight days of March averaged 2.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) including oil from the neutral zone shared with Kuwait, compared to a February average of 3.5 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world, which OPEC says must be counted towards a member's production quota. Saudi Arabia's quota is 4.133 mln bpd. The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia, the world"s largest oil exporter, was insisting on getting Opec official prices, even at the cost of lower production, the sources said. King Fahd reiterated yesterday, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, the Saudi commitment to OPEC's December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs. "Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions," he said. The sources said the kingdom's exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday, down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd. They said Saudi Arabia was allowing production to fluctuate with lifting nominations and was not trying to maintain artificially high levels by putting oil into storage. The kingdom's main buyers, the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco -- Mobil, Exxon, Texaco and Chevron -- enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices, the sources said. Spot market prices have firmed in the past two weeks but still remain below OPEC levels and major buyers have delayed liftings in the hope they would improve, the sources said. They expected low early March output to pick up towards the end of the month as buyers sought to fulfill their contractual obligations. REUTER 
MONTEDISON, OTHER REFINERIES TO SHUT FOR WORK

Selm-Societa Energia Montedison is to close its Priolo crude refining units from March 15th to March 28th for maintenance, a company spokesman said. Throughput at the refinery is currently estimated at 140-150,000 bpd, although total capacity is nearer 200,000 bpd. Several other Mediterranean refineries are currently shutdown for maintenance, most of which were scheduled some months ago. But industry sources said that shutdowns may have been rearranged to avoid running negative-netback crude. Tighter availabilities of products as a result of the shutdowns in the Med is helping to keep products markets bullish, particularly for March deliveries, oil traders said. Garrone's refinery at San Quirico (capacity 130,000 bpd) is due to shutdown on March 14th for three weeks, and the jointly-owned ISAB/Garrone refinery at Mellili, capacity 220,000 bpd, is due to start up around March 20-25th following its closure for maintenance a month ago, a company spokesman said. The Esso Italiana refineries at Augusta and Siracusa will not be closing this spring, a spokesman for the company said. In France, the distillation unit at Societe Francaise de BP's Lavera refinery has been closed for maintenance since March 2, and is due to restart early April. Total capacity is 181,900 bpd. It is currently operating at around 50 pct capacity, a company spokesman said. Shell Francaise's Berre l'Etang refinery will shut down in early April until mid-June, a company spokesman said. Capacity is around 150,000 bpd. Compagnie Francaise de Raffinage (CFR) will close the visbreaker at its La Mede refinery in early April, but would not affect crude throughput at the refinery, a company spokesman said. Current capacity is 136,000 bbl/day. Despite current bullish sentiment in the Med, however, traders noted that crude netbacks are beginning to look more attractive, and most maintenance shutdowns should be finished in two to three weeks. As a result, oil industry sources suggest that the situation may ease by mid-April. Reuter 

Continuous rebel raids against oil pipelines and foreign exploration camps endanger Colombia's present oil bonanza, Franciso Chona, manager of the state-run oil company Ecopetrol said. "It seems the subversion wants to end with our oil bonanza," he told reporters.

Ecopetrol chief of security, Retired General Carlos Narvaez, said security measures would be stricter and that the armed forces were closely collaborating but gave no details. Samudio said new plans had been designed and hoped they would be effective. Samudio stressed that, despite the most recent attacks, which cost more than four mln dlrs in damage, the overall situation had improved compared with last December when initial measures were taken to combat a wave of attacks. Repeated bombings of a vital pipeline from the Cano Limon oilfield to the Caribbean then led to a loss of 51,000 barrels of crude. Reuter 

BRAZIL CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA

Brazil's state-oil company, Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said. Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil. But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere. "Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage," he said. Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said. Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are "reasonably balanced." Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere," Santana added. Reuter 
VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50,000 BPD OF CRUDE

Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today. He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a visit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in August. Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to offsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week. Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao was put out of action. Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses. Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs. The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries. "If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this country would have ground to a halt," he said. Reuter 

"Of course the spot price will fluctuate, but the official price will remain at 18 dlrs," he added. REUTER 
OPEC DEFENDING 18 DLR PRICE, SUBROTO SAYS

Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said OPEC is deliberately under its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels to defend its 18 dlr a barrel price target. He told reporters at an energy conference in Jakarta that OPEC had decided to maintain its price level of 18 dlrs. "We are deliberately defending the price, so OPEC production is less than 15.8 (mln) at the moment," he stated. Asked if OPEC would increase production if prices went above 18 dlrs a barrel, he said this would be decided at the next OPEC meeting in June. "We will discuss the market situation then," he added. He said a meeting of the OPEC Differentials Committee had been postponed because "there is no need for the meeting." He did not elaborate. The committee had originally been due to meet in Vienna this week. REUTER 
PETROBRAS CANCELS OIL PURCHASE FROM SAUDI ARABIA

Brazil's state oil company Petrobras has cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil and did not disclose reasons, a Petrobras official said. Export director Carlos Santana told reporters the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of consumption. He said the Saudis reported they would no longer accept letters of credit from the Bank of Brazil or even from Saudi banks and that Brazil would have to obtain credit guarantees from leading international banks. In February, Brazil had contracted to buy 125,000 bpd from the Saudis until June. Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship...I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere," Santana added. Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. The Saudis had put similar conditions on a previous shipment, he added. "We telexed them saying that if they insisted, we would rather cancel the contract and buy the product elsewhere," Santana said. After Petrobras threatened to cancel the contract, the Saudis changed their minds and decided to accept the Bank of Brazil's credit guarantees, he said. REUTER 

PETROBRAS ASKS ARMY TO WITHDRAW TROOPS

Brazil's state-oil company Petrobras has asked the Army to withdraw the troops which were occupying its oil installations since Tuesday, Petrobras said in a statement. The statement said the request for the withdrawal of the troops was made because of the calmness reigning in all of its refineries. "The request was also due to the end of the seamen's strike and the willingness of the oil industry workers to sit again by the negotiating table," the statement said. Even though the Petrobras statement said the seamen's strike was over, a union spokesman said only two small shipping companies had reached a pay agreement. The overwhelming majority of Brazil's seamen remained on strike. The statement said a meeting between Petrobras and oil industry leaders was set for next Wednesday in Rio, with the presence of Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto as a mediator. Petrobras said the request for the withdrawal of the troops was made at 1100 local hours (1400 GMT), but a company spokesman said he did not know if the troops had already been removed. Reuter 
BRAZILIAN TROOPS TO LEAVE OIL REFINERIES

Brazil's labour troubles eased a little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing troops from the country's main oil installations occupied three days ago. The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil industry employees. Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their willingness to negotiate a pay deal. A national seamen's strike, however, continued and marines remained in the country's main ports. The marines were despatched to the ports after the seamen's strike, now two weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday. A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135 in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports. Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase. Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a sign that the national strike could soon come to an end. Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union leaders said the vast majority of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike. The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de Janeiro next Wednesday. Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator. Besides industrial troubles, there has also been considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector. On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies throughout the country to protest against high interest rates. Television reports showed some of these protests still continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana. The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a deterioration in its trade balance. On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to private banks. Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange. Reuter 
ECUADOR BEGINS WORK ON OIL PIPELINE TO COLOMBIA

Construction workers today began building a 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador's jungle oilfields to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry officials said. They said it would take about two months and at least 15 mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia's Pacific Ocean coast. The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said. The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about 17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean energy ministry official said. The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic demand. The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an earthquake the night before. The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungle oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific Ocean. Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the earthquake. It would take about five months to repair the pipeline to Balao, government officials said. Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln dlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake, energy ministry Javier Espinosa said. Reuter 
VENEZUELA TO LEND UP TO 12.5 MLN BARRELS OF OIL

Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5 mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement. Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake. Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said. Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that would take an estimated five months. Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired. Both countries are the only Latin American members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the earthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total output was around 260,000 bpd. Reuter 
PDVSA TO SIGN CHAMPLIN REFINERY DEAL MARCH 17

Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. said it will sign a contract March 17 to buy a half interest in a Corpus Christi, Texas refinery and related operations. The contract, to be signed by PDVSA and Champlin Petroleum's parent company, the Union Pacific Corp <UNP>, will create a new joint venture called Champlin Refining. The state oil company said PDVSA will pay on the order of 30 mln dlrs for the half interest in Champlin. Energy minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said Wednesday the cost would be 33 mln dlrs in cash, plus an additional 60 mln in crude and refined oil shipments. PDVSA and Union Pacific have sought a line of credit from a group of North American and Japanese banks to finance the new company's working capital, the Venezuelan company said. Under the deal, PDVSA will supply up to 140,000 barrels a day to the refinery with the option to place 50,000 bpd more - mostly gasoline and distillates - through Champlin's distribution system in 10 U.S. states. The new company will be directed by a six-member board, with three representatives each from PDVSA and Union Pacific. Reuter 
SAUDIS DROP CONDITION FOR OIL SALE TO BRAZIL

YUGOSLAVIAN OIL FIRM STARTS WORKING WITH FRENCH

Yugoslavia's top oil and natural gas producer <Ina-Naftaplin> has started to implement a cooperation contract signed last year with the French petrochemical concern <Petro Chemie>, the official Tanjug news agency said. Under the deal Petro Chemie supplies oil to Ina refineries in Sisak and Rijeka and ships parts to 12 Yugoslav firms in the petrochemical, chemical, textile and plastics industries. The Yugoslav firms, in turn, will export oil products to France. Tanjug said this year's exchange will value 530 mln dlrs. Ina signed a similar deal with West Germany's Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> two years ago. Ina also has joint ventures and co-production projects, involving Yugoslavia's other main producer <Naftagas> of Novi Sad, with partners in Angola, Algeria and Tunisia, exploring for and exploiting oil and natural gas. An estimated 300,000 tonnes of oil will thus be obtained from fields in Angola over the next 15 years, Tanjug said. Ina accounts for some 75 pct of Yugoslavia's total oil production, which amounts to 4.2 mln tonnes a year. Ina earned more than 154 mln dlrs from exports of goods and services to 39 countries last year and ranks among Yugoslavia's leading export enterprises. In a separate statement issued through Tanjug, Ina said it has successfully completed the first drill at the depth of over 3,000 meters in the Bay of Baes, in Tunisia. Ina is jointly prospecting with the U.S. Firm Conoco for oil and gas there. Work on a second drill, below 4,000 meters, would start soon in the Bay of Gabes, the statement said. Ina would invest about 8.5 mln dlrs in prospecting in the Gabes area. Conoco, which has completed geological prospecting for the Tunisian government, has transferred one third of its option rights in the region to Ina, it said. REUTER 
BRAZILIAN BANK WORKERS DECIDE ON NATIONAL STRIKE

Brazilian bank workers voted to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour unrest arising from the failure of the government's anti-inflation plan. At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24 unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met. Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks. The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company Petrobras. The government ordered thousands of troops into the refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the troops were removed yesterday. Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their willingess to negotiate next Wednesday. The government has also sent marines into the main ports. A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de Janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise. Seamen employed by two small companies have already accepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about 5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras. Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high interest rates charged by banks. According to official estimates, prices rose by more than 33 pct in the first two months of this year. REUTER 
SAUDI OIL MINISTER FORESEES NO NEED FOR NEW OPEC MEASURES BEFORE JUNE 25



SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER OPEC PACT

Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: "I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled." Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements. "We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified," he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price. "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement," he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC. "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability," he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states. "Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC," Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures." Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year. "We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions," Nazer said. He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit. REUTER 
SAUDI BUSINESSMEN TO DISCUSS PRIVATE SECTOR

Saudi Arabian business leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom's oil-dependent economy. The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices. The four-day conference in this resort town, high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea, has been organised by Saudi Arabia's chambers of commerce. Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day. Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year's slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance. Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy. The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans. Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel. With oil prices recovering, Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves. The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community. Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November, while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans. But not all bankers are convinced. One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said: "Banks are still reluctant to lend ... There is certainly more optimism in the air, but I am not sure if it is firmly based." Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting. Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply. A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said: "While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government's highest priorities, the recession, the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry." It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here. Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986, compared with the same period in 1985. Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a major source of industry backing, has fallen steadily since 1983. Trading companies have also been hit, some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit. Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories. Others have effectively been liquidated. A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repayments. The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC. Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt. Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom. A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg.

MEES SAYS SECOND WEEK MARCH OPEC OUTPUT 14 MLN BPD

OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated. A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd. MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of its total production into floating storage. Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output, including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd. The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower than that. It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a further 25,000 bpd of "purchase crude." It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only 2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift at official prices. MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member countries calling for the formation of a committee to study what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among various members. The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was having difficulty selling crude at official prices. The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and "other forms of hydrocarbons" which are marketed in package deals with crude oil.

ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN

President Leon Febres Cordero said Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments. Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt. "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," the president said during a visit to the quake zone. "A government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain." Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said. He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake, which killed at least 300 people. Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced. He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited. Reuter 

NORWAY APPROVES TRADE BAN AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA

Norway's parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said. The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway's minority Labour government, gives domestic companies until late September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and Namibia. "The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an isolated measure, but as a step in an international process," Norway's foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament. Government officials said they hope the move will intensify international pressure against the Pretoria regime's apartheid policies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt all trade with South Africa by October. Norway's boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important exception for ships whose final destination is decided while they are at sea. Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading, making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships' final port at the start of a voyage. Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued oil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa. Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said. The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure. "Many would say that the law has already had its effect because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and Norway," Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters. "Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law. "No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on international trade with South Africa, but it is an important political statement by the Norwegian government," he said. The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the ban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law. Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to high-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it ferro-alloys and light metals industries. Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be affected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores are not found. The legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said. Reuter 
LOOPHOLE FOR TANKERS IN NORWAY'S S. AFRICA BAN

Norway's parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said. The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late September to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia. Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, the boycott makes a crucial exception for ships whose final destination is decided while at sea. As oil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said the door will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa. Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude oil imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said. The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure.

OPEC WANTS 18 DLR OIL PRICE - OAPEC OFFICIAL

OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today. In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: "OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs." But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases. "For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production," Al-Wattari said. "Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained," Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures, some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added. Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said. "A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation," he added. He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC. But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were insufficient in terms of volume, he added. "The overall majority of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's calls for supply regulation," he said. Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added. Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market. Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue. Reuter 
VENEZUELA-ECUADOR OIL LOAN UNDER DISCUSSION

Venezuela has still to work out final details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports caused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) official said. "We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be affected," he said during the signing of a joint venture deal with Union Pacific Corp today. He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite. He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be considered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters, requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market. Ecuador's oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador's account and remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at a rate of 35,000 bpd. He said Venezuela's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company never allows third parties to trade its oil. Reuter 

KUWAIT SAYS NO OPEC MEMBER VIOLATING OUTPUT QUOTA

Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the 13-nation group. Sheikh Ali told Kuwait's daily al-Anba "All OPEC states, without exception, are producing within the quotas allocated to them. Some of them are producing less." Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab Emirates, which had been generally been producing over its quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of this year. Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but an earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected its quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell. OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the first six months of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.

IRAQ SAYS IT ATTACKS TWO SHIPS IN GULF

Iraq said its warplanes hit two ships off the Iranian coast in attacks last night and early today. The planes "dealt accurate and effective blows to both maritime targets before they returned safely to base," a military spokesman told the Iraqi new agency INA. There was no immediate confirmation of the attacks from Persian Gulf shipping sources. The last confirmed Iraqi attack on shipping was on March 8, when an Iranian tanker was hit by a missile south of Iran's Kharg island oil export terminal. Gulf shipping sources yesterday reported an Iranian warship had set the Cypriot supertanker Pivot on fire with a missile. They said there were no injuries on board and the ship headed for the Gulf Emirate of Fujairah under its own power after the fire was put out. The Pivot was the 18th ship hit this year in the maritime extension of the 6-1/2 year-old Iran-Iraq war. Reuter 
MALAYSIA TO CUT OIL OUTPUT FURTHER, TRADERS SAY

Malaysia's state oil company Petronas will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May 1, trade sources said. Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level. Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid-1987. However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510,000 bpd in 1987. The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks, the sources said. Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said. Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output. The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said. In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender, the sources said. However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the reduced scale of production, they said. 

MEXICAN HYDROCARBON RESERVES FALL SLIGHTLY IN 1986

mexico's proven reserves of liquid hydrocarbons at end-1986 were 70 billion barrels, slightly down from 70.9 billion a year ago and 71.75 billion in 1984, the state oil company petroleos mexicanos (pemex) announced. Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72 billion in both 1981 and 1982. In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in 1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985. Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd. The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was crude oil, but has previouly said it was about 48 pct. Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per day, down from 3.6 billion in 1985. Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from 25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production, were suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of production.

NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CLOSE REFINERY - ESSO SAF

ESSO SAF <ESSF.PA>, the French subsidiary of Exxon Corp <XON>, said it had no immediate plans to shut down one of its two refineries. Exxon's new president Lee R. Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French refinery. An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that depended on the evolution of the market and refineries' ability to make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses. The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the spokesman added. Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant. Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close one of its French refineries. Reuter 

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - SAUDI ARABIA RESHAPES ECONOMY

Higher world oil prices, coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity, could lift Saudi Arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits, bankers and diplomats said. The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector. Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct, the first rise since 1982. But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long. Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price. Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day (bpd), well down on Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987. King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy. Saudi Arabia, still the world's largest oil exporter, is a hugely wealthy country. But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985. Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981. "Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects," a diplomat said. In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs. But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term. It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy. Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to "tough it out" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves. The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out. Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year. "It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy," he said. Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary. The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom. Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced, markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply. The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector, have become highly selective in extending new credit. Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment. Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit. As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector, one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.

ECUADOR GETS LOAN TO HELP REPAIR OIL PIPELINE

The Andean Development Corp (CAF) said today it is lending 11.7 mln dlrs to Ecuador to help repair 25 miles of oil pipeline destroyed by an earthquake earlier this month. the loan was signed here today in the offices of the caracas based caf by the corporation's president, galo montano perez and ecuadorean ambassador antonio parra gil. the loan had originally been intended to finance an expansion of the pipeline, but following the earthquake the ecuadorean government asked for the terms to be changed so as to permit their use in reconstruction. Ecuador expects oil production to be suspended for four months as a result of the damage, and has asked Venezuela to help by supplying 50,000 barrels per day while the pipeline is repaired. The OPEC member has a production quota of 210,000 bpd but has asked the organization to allow it to produce 310,000 bpd once the repairs are completed so as to compensate the loss. Reuter 
REAGAN SAYS U.S. MUST DO MORE TO LESSEN RELIANCE ON FOREIGN OIL



WORLD BANK LIKELY TO URGE CHANGES ON JAKARTA

World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said. Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half. Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost protected economy. "Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support," Conable said in his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes. "We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed," Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold. But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation. He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector. Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87.

AUSTRALIA SAID TO RELY TOO MUCH ON OIL TAXES

The government's over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said. Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here. This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the country's economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said. Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat, yet the government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry, Benbow said. Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from 546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields, he said. Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said. By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said. Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said. Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years time, he said. At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said. Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said. For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said. He called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration. REUTER 
EXXON OFFICIAL URGES PLANNING FOR NEXT OIL SURGE

World governments should prepare for an inevitable significant increase in the price of oil as non-Middle East supplies diminish, Exxon Corp <XON> director and senior vice-president Donald McIvor said. Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference. It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact, he said. McIvor said 37 of the world's 30,000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered. Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said. He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year. More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East, he said. McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability. "It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of acreage for exploration," he said. Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum, he added. REUTER 
AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT

A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output, resources analyst Ian Story said here. A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference. Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd. Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said. The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-in production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue, he said. He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct. "The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs," Story said. Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development, he said. The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure. REUTER 
BP GRANGEMOUTH REFINERY SHUT, HYDROCRACKER DAMAGED

The entire British Petroleum Co PLC refinery at Grangemouth in Scotland has been shut down following the explosion and fire that severely damaged the hydrocracker at the site, a refinery spokesman said. He said the rest of the 178,500 bpd refinery, including the 19,000 bpd catalytic cracker, was undamaged. The whole refinery was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the main units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said. But there was extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to gasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months. The spokesman said BP will not suffer supply shortages as a result of the explosion as it will be able to bring in product from other sources. BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam, a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant. He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation. The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of its capacity since the end of January while an extensive overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where the hydrocracker is sited, he said. This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident. Two people were killed in an explosion and fire in a flare line at the Grangemouth refinery on March 13, but the spokesman said this incident was some 100 yards from the latest accident. REUTER 

IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS

Iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said. The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran's oil export trade. A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war front. It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf. Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their occupants and the others fled, it said. Reuter 
IRAQ REPLACES OIL MINISTER IN BIG GOVT SHUFFLE

Iraqi President Saddam Hussein carried out his first major government shakeup in five years tonight, naming a new oil minister in shuffling three posts. One minister was dropped in the shuffle, announced in a presidential decree. It gave no reason for the changes in the government of the Arab Baath Socialist Party which has ruled Iraq since a revolution in 1968. The decree named the head of the Iraqi National Oil Company (INOC), Isam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalaby, to take over as oil minister replacing Qassem Ahmed Taqi. Taqi, appointed oil minister in the last significant government reorganization in 1982, was moved to be minister of heavy industries. Reuter 
IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS

Iraq said its warplanes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said. Reuter 
AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SEES TARGETED OIL TAX STRATEGY

Australia's crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here. He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government's economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns. Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation. Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years. These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September, he said. The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia's relatively low exploration levels. "While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes, which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas," Evans said. He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible. As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects. APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects. Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government's desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules.

WORLD BANK CHIEF PLEDGES SUPPORT TO INDONESIA

World Bank president Barber Conable pledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed. Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto, he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy. Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years. Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices. "We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy," he said. He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries. Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy. However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place. Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country. REUTER 
KUWAIT SAYS OPEC 2.4 MLN BPD BELOW CEILING

Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said OPEC was producing well below its oil output ceiling and this would help prices move higher, according to a Kuwaiti newspaper interview. The al-Rai al-Aam newspaper quoted him as saying OPEC was pumping 2.4 mln barrels per day (bpd) less than its 15.8 mln bpd ceiling, while consumers were drawing down their petroleum stocks at a rate of 4.5 mln bpd. As long as OPEC maintains its output curbs, demand for its oil will rise in April and May, Sheikh Ali said, adding that Kuwait was strongly committed to its OPEC quota. REUTER 
AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN

The council of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia's petroleum taxation structure. The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government's position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference. As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum. APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said. It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation. Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure. "The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based," the APEA council said. The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's problems, the council said. The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices. REUTER 

SHELL TO DECLARE NORWAY'S DRAUGEN FIELD COMMERCIAL

<A/S Norske Shell>, Royal Dutch/Shell Group's <RD.AS> Norwegian subsidiary, said it has nearly concluded a 10 billion crown development scheme for Norway's Draugen oil field and will declare the field commercial in the near future. Pending government approval of the scheme, the field could come on stream in 1992, making it Norway's northermost field development and the first such project on the Haltenbanken tract off central Norway. Work on the project could begin as early as January 1988, a Shell spokesman said. Shell has not released projected output levels for the field, where water depth is 240-270 meters. The spokesman said the field's partners have agreed to develop Draugen with a 300-meter, single-leg concrete gravity-base platform. The scheme also proposes using remote subsea production wells to tap the field's reservoir, estimated to contain 375 mln barrels of oil, and an offshore buoy-loading system to transport oil from the field by ship. Partners on Draugen are Shell, the operator, with a 30 pct stake, British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> unit <BP Petroleum Development (Norway) Ltd> (20 pct) and state-owned Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S <STAT.OL> (Statoil) (50 pct).

MADAGASCAR EXTENDS AMOCO OIL EXPLORATION AGREEMENT

Madagascar extended its oil exploration agreement with the U.S. Firm Amoco Corp <AN> for 17 months to allow for further studies of the Morondava basin on the southwest coast, a government statement said. It said the existing five-year agreement, due to expire this July 24, was extended until the end of 1988 to allow for additional geological and geophysical studies. Amoco has so far laid 7,100 km of seismic lines and sunk five exploration wells in the Morondava basin. It may drill a further three wells before the end of the extended exploration period, the statement said. Madagascar has signed oil exploration agreements with four foreign oil companies since 1981. But despite promising indications of large reserves, no commercial production plans have yet been announced. The foreign firms - Amoco, Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY>, Mobil Corp <MOB> and a unit of <Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi> - are working in partnership with the National Military Office for Strategic Industries (OMNIS). Roland Ratsimandresy, the director general of OMNIS, said at a ceremenony to sign the extension of the Amoco agreement that his department would intensify oil exploration with its existing partners and would soon offer a new round of exploration licences.

ABU DHABI TO REOPEN GULF OILFIELD HIT IN 1986 RAID

Abu Dhabi's offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry sources said. They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles (Total) <TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed. Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi, last November 25. The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform. Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq. Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable. The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations, the sources said. Facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources said. Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production, the sources said. They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field, part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only a few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked. REUTER 
OIL ANALYST SEES PAPUA NEW GUINEA AS GOOD PROSPECT

Papua New Guinea (PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun Fesharaki said here. The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference. Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific petroleum outlook. With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991, PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki said. The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG. The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels. PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said. "We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to (light) Bass Strait crude," Fesharaki said. There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said. But prices should be somewhat higher than the present levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said. The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG. REUTER 
NORWAY OFFERS 11TH LICENCE ROUND OFFSHORE BLOCKS

Norway has offered 10 new offshore blocks to foreign and domestic applicants in the first phase of the country's eleventh concession round, government officials said. Company shares in each of the licences proposed by the Oil and Energy Ministry are not final. The ministry has given the companies 10 days to accept or decline the proposed shares. French companies Ste Nationale Elf Aquitaine <ELFP.PA> and Total Cie Francaise des Petroles <TPN.PA>, which were expected to receive operatorships following France's agreement last autumn to purchase gas from Norway's Troll field, were not offered operatorships in this round, industry sources said. Three eleventh round blocks were awarded in the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway, including the Smoerbukk West field where Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S <STAT.OL> (Statoil) was appointed operator. Statoil will share the licence with subsidiaries of U.S. Oil companies Tenneco Inc <TGT.N> and Texas Eastern Corp <TET.N> and the Italian oil company <Agip SpA>'s Norwegian subsidiary. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours <DD.N> subsidiary Conoco Norway Inc was named operator on Haltenbanken block 6406/8 and will share the licence with Statoil. Norsk Hydro A/S <NHY.OL> will operate nearby block 6407/10 with partners Statoil, Norsk Agip A/S, Royal Dutch/Shell Group's <RD.AS> A/S Norske Shell and <Deminex> unit Deminex (Norge) A/S. Statoil has been offered the operatorship on a new block in the relatively unexplored Moere South exploration area south of Haltenbanken, with A/S Norske Shell, Texas Eastern and <Petroleo Brasileiro SA> (Petrobras) also offered stakes in the block. Norwegian companies landed operatorships on all six blocks opened in the Barents Sea area off northern Norway. The blocks were awarded in three licenses, each covering two blocks. Statoil will head exploration on blocks 7224/7 and 7224/8, sharing the licence with Exxon Corp's <XON.N> Norwegian subsidiary Esso Norge A/S, The British Petroleum Co PLC's <BP.L> BP Petroleum Development (Norway) Ltd, Shell, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum A/S <SAGP.OL>.

LATIN OIL PRODUCERS TO MEET IN CARACAS

Five regional oil producing nations will gather in Caracas tommorrow for a two-day meeting expected to center on ways to combat proposals for a U.S. tax on imported petroleum, the Venezuela's ministry of energy and mines said. Oil ministers from Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Ecuador and Venezuela will be on hand for the fifth meeting of the informal group of Latin American and Caribbean Petroleum Exporters, formed in 1983, it said. Colombia will also attend for the first time, as an observer nation, the ministry said. Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said the conference has no set agenda but one entire session Friday will be devoted to proposals for a tax on imported oil. Two of the group's members, Venezuela and Mexico, are second and third largest foreign suppliers of oil to the United States, respectively, following Canada. Venezuela, concerned about the effect such a tax would have on its exports, undertook a diplomatic push to coordinate strategy against such measures. In February, Canadian Energy Minister Marcel Masse was invited to Caracas for talks with Hernandez on proposals for an oil import tax. Reuter 

Brazilian crude oil and liquefied natural gas production fell to an average 583,747 barrels per day in February from 596,740 in the same 1986 month, the state oil company Petrobras said. The drop was due to operating problems in the Campos Basin, the country's main producing area, where output was down to 346,011 bpd from 357,420, a Petrobras statement said. Consumption of oil derivatives totalled 1.14 mln bpd in February, 16.7 pct up on February last year but down from the record 1.22 mln bpd used in October last year. Use of alcohol fuel in February was 208,600 bpd, 42 pct above February, 1986. Reuter 
PAPANDREOU SAYS GREEKS READY FOR AGGRESSORS

Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea. Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens "the military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions." He said the activities of the research vessel could be aimed at partitioning the Aegean. "The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert," General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, told a news conference. He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning. Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area. The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey. Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus. The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover. Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a government decision that Turkey should protect its interests "because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in violation of international agreements." Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the vessels, he said "If there is an attack, it is clear what has to be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war." But he added "We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the military are directed towards protecting our rights." Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions Athens had attached. In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations "we will hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped with words." Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only "The Greek fleet is not at its naval base." Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek continental shelf. Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept it. Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus. He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied "Obviously, and perhaps even before the war." REUTER 

He and other political leaders spoke of qualified optimism following a statement by Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal last night that the research vessel would not enter disputed waters as previously annnounced unless Greek vessels did so. The Prime Minister declined to answer reporters' questions about an announcement last night that Greece had asked the United States to suspend operations at one of the American military bases here due to the crisis. But Opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis told reporters he thought the suspension would be temporary until the crisis is resolved. A U.S. Defence Department official in Washington said the station was still functioning. Communist Party leader Harilaos Florakis said here "the climate is calmer today." Greek newspapers reported that the Greek army, navy and air force had been moved to strategic Greek islands in the Aegean and to the land border with Turkey at the Evros River. But there was no official word on military movements apart from a comment by the government spokesman that the Greek navy was no longer in port. The United States, NATO and the United Nations all called on Greece and Turkey to exercise restraint. Greek U.N.

TURKISH-GREEK AEGEAN TENSION ABATES

Turkey"s standoff with Greece over Aegean oil rights appeared at an end after the government said it had been assured Athens would not start prospecting in disputed waters. A Foreign Ministry statement last night hinted Turkey was claiming victory. A Greek-based international consortium, North Aegean Petroleum Co., Had given up plans to start searching for oil in international waters east of Thasos island, it said. "In the same way it has been understood that Greece will also not undertake oil activities outside its territorial waters," the statement added. An Ankara Radio report monitored in London said Foreign Minister Vahit Halefolu had called on Greece to engage in dialogue over the dispute. It was impossible to resolve the dispute by crises, he was quoted as saying. "We call on Greece to come and engage in a dialogue with us - let us find a solution as two neighbours and allies should," he said. The radio said Halefoglu had briefed the leaders of a number of the country"s political parties on the latest developments. Turkey sent the survey ship Sismik 1 into the Aegean yesterday, flanked by warships, to press its case but having earlier said it would go into disputed waters, declared the vessel would stay in Turkish areas. Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, in London on his way home after heart surgery in the United States, is expected to receive an ecstatic welcome from thousands of Turks when he returns today. He was in defiant mood last night, telling Turkish radio: "We can never accept that Greece should confine us to the Anatolian continent. If there are riches under the sea, they are for mankind." Despite the end of the crisis, Turkish officials acknowledged that the underlying dispute over delimiting the continental shelf in the Aegean remained unsolved. Turkey alleged that the consortium"s plans would have infringed the 1976 Berne agreement between the two countries, which called for a moratorium on any activities until the delimitation was agreed. Greece earlier this month declared it considers the accord inoperative. REUTER 
BANK SEES MODEST RECOVERY IN GULF ARAB ECONOMIES

The Emirates Industrial Bank has predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues. A bank study, carried by the Emirates news agency WAM, said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production. These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-1986 to around 18 dlrs. "All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these (GCC) countries, although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the (1970s) boom years," the study said. It added, however, that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts. The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year. It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985. The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985, it added. REUTER 

INDONESIA LIMITS OIL PRICE IMPACT-FINANCE MINISTER

Indonesia has minimised the economic impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said. Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half. But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the previous year. Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said, although he did not give complete figures. The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber, palm oil, tin, timber and coffee. Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments. He said the economy would have suffered more from the world economic recession if the government had not devalued the rupiah by 31 pct last September. In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post said the government must press ahead with measures to deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports. The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were needed to finance not only imports but also the country's growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs. "About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due within the next three to five years and will steadily increase the debt servicing burden," the paper said. However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers said. Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar's nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate rebound to halt further dollar depreciation. A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this afternoon were taken favourably by the market. REUTER 
MEXICAN FIRST QTR CRUDE EXPORTS SEEN AT 15.25 DLRS

The average price of mexico's crude oil exports in first quarter 1987 will be 15.25 dlrs per barrel, according to preliminary figures issued in a press release by the state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX). It gave no direct comparison with the year-ago figure but said crude and products sales were expected to rise to 1.99 billion dlrs this quarter, 420 mln dlrs higher than expected and 22 pct better than the year-ago quarter. Prospects for the second quarter were relatively favourable with crude exports seen at 1.320 mln bpd after an expected 1.324 mln this month, 1.323 in February and 1.395 mln in January. REUTER 

VENEZUELA WANTS TO BOOST ITS REFINING CAPACITY

Venezuela's state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. wants to raise its worldwide refining capacity by 150,000 barrels of per day, a company official attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting here said. He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has the capacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refining centers in Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the United States. The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in the Corpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, a subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp <UNP>. Earlier it bought a similar stake in the Lake Charles, La refinery owned by Citgo Petroleum Corp, a unit of Southland Corp <SLC>. According to the official, Venezuela is searching worldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did not mention where the company was looking. Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to refiners. He said Venezuela currently produces about 1.4 mln bpd of crude oil, which is in line with its 1.495 bpd OPEC ceiling. Reuter 
CSR SELLS OIL/GAS INTERESTS, BIDS TO EXTEND SUGAR

CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share analysts said. CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead sell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs. In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd. A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright CSR had given itself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said. The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the largest stake in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country, they said. Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid, through which CSR would benefit from the bottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. REUTER 

MADRID METRO HALTED AS SPANISH STRIKES SPREAD

An estimated 1.2 mln metro users in Madrid were stranded today as striking railway workers halted the underground transport system, industry sources said. The strikers joined coal miners, steel and oil refinery workers in Spain's latest wave of stoppages over wage demands. Some 10,000 pitmen in the northern province of Leon entered the second day of an indefinite stoppage to demand wage rises and a five-day working week, the sources said. Oil refinery workers picketed the state-owned Empresa Nacional de Petroleo SA (EMP) to prevent fuel lorries leaving the company's largest plant in Puertollano, central Spain. Paramilitary police were guarding steel mills at Reinosa, in northern Spain, from the daily protests against planned job cuts. A local government official said the police force would remain in place until tempers had cooled down. More than 60 people were injured in pitched battles between police and steel foundry workers in Reinosa last month. REUTER 

UAE OIL PRODUCTION DROPS TEN PCT IN MARCH

Oil output in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) dropped ten pct in March from February to an average 1.05 mln barrels per day (bpd), mainly because of customer resistance to fixed prices of Abu Dhabi oil, industry sources said. The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buy Abu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs a barrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72 dlrs. The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAE producer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of 800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months. Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd from around 370,000 in February after the emirate declared a mid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, the sources added. Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaif and Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixed prices too high and cut liftings, the sources said. The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japanese term buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, they added. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of it Murban. Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came on stream in 1983, to be test production not included in calculations for complying with the OPEC quota. Without Upper Zakum, the UAE would be producing roughly its quota in March, the sources added. REUTER 
IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND

Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct, it said. The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels. IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same level as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March. It is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, the IEA noted. Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Saudi Arabia"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd. REUTER 
IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND

Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency said.

And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Reuter 
OIL MARKET LIKELY TO REMAIN STABLE, SUBROTO SAYS

Indonesian Energy minister Subroto said he was very confident of continued stability in the oil market because of the determination of Opec members to maintain a price of 18 dlrs a barrel. "We are very confident that things will continue this way. The short-term outlook is favourable because of the resolution of Opec to stick to the 18 dlr price," he said at a signing ceremony for a new Indonesian production sharing agreement. He said Opec output continued to remain slightly under its agreed ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels, and he expected prices to firm slightly in the third quarter of the year. He said at Opec's next meeting in Vienna in June, members will face the choice of either maintaining present volume and seeing prices rise a bit, or raising the production ceiling so that members could produce more in the third and fourth quarters of 1987. He gave no figures for how much he thought volume could be raised without undermining the 18 dlr target, or any indication of which option he preferred. REUTER 
ENIM OIL SIGNS CONTRACT WITH INDONESIA'S PERTAMINA

<Enim Oil Co Ltd>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <Southern Cross Ltd> of Colorado, signed a production sharing contract with Indonesia's state oil company Pertamina to explore for oil in the Lematang block of Sumatra. It was the second production sharing contract signed by Pertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986. The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presence of Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oil production split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour. Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mln dlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first two years. The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oil producing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials said there is a good chance of getting a high return on investment. A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilled before, was neglected because it is deeper than surrounding blocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have now made seismic survey possible. The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contract Pertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February. Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina's favour with operational costs deducted. Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil's production share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interest in the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it finds oil. Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude for refining in Indonesia if its share exceeds 150,000 barrels a day. REUTER 

TURKEY CALLS FOR DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DISPUTE

Turkey said today its disputes with Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea, should be solved through negotiations. A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute and an agreement on this issue would effect the security, economy and other rights of both countries. "As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be found by bilateral negotiations," the statement said. Greece has repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the International Court of Justice. The two countries approached armed confrontation last month after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil. A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to territorrial waters. "The latest crises created an historic opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries," the Foreign Ministry statement said.

ECUADOR CRUDE OIL OUTPUT TO RESUME NEXT MONTH

Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil output on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring Colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said. Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific. About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some 50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said. Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the earthquake. The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in Colombia, the starting point of Columbia's pipeline to the Pacific ocean port of Temuco. The government estimates it will take about four more months to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return output to normal levels, the spokesman said. REUTER 

ABU DHABI MARKETING SAID NOT BREACHING OPEC PACT

A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its crude oil without breaching OPEC accords. Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations. "The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its customers in accordance with market conditions...And take necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production," he said. "The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to stabilize the market," he added. OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel. Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future depended on how much discipline OPEC showed. Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was ADNOC's most difficult ever but "a practical and flexible pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market environment." He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average 609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported. In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products. Reuter 
ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION

Ecuador will resume limited crude output next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said. CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to neighbouring Colombia. Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific port of Balao. It will take at least until the end of July to repair the pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor. To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying 55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco. The original target date to resume limited crude output was May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman said. Reuter 
ASIA TRYING TO FOSTER OIL EXPLORATION, SAYS U.N.

Asian countries are offering better oil exploration concessions to avert damaging shortfalls due to last year's oil price slump, the United Nations said. The Bangkok-based U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific said in its annual report that the price fall substantially cut exploration by foreign oil firms, which found it unprofitable to maintain investments in the region. Oil production investment in Indonesia fell to about 2.8 billion dlrs in 1985 from 3.2 billion in 1983 and was estimated to have declined six pct last year. There were 11 wells drilled in Thailand in 1986 against 64 in 1985. The report said <Thai Shell Exploration and Production Co Ltd>, a unit of the <Royal Dutch/Shell Group> announced a 30 pct cut in exploration and production spending last year. To counter declining output, India and Malaysia reduced petroleum sharing demands, while Indonesia cut taxes. Nepal offered a guaranteed income share of up to 87.5 pct to cover exploration costs, while Thailand began decreasing its 12.5 pct royalty payments. The big losers were major regional exporters such as Indonesia, Brunei, China, Malaysia and Iran. Their aggregate oil income fell an estimated 20 billion dlrs in 1986 from 40 billion the previous year. Indonesia's export earnings fell by nearly half in 1986 from 11.6 billion dlrs in 1985, the U.N. Report said. Iran also lost about six billion dlrs, Brunei 3.8 billion, China three billion and Malaysia 0.8 billion. However, Asian importers saved between eight and nine billion dlrs during 1985 and 1986, which considerably eased their balance of payments. South Korea, the Philippines, India, Thailand and Pakistan were major beneficiaries, with Thailand and Pakistan respectively saving about 875 mln and 435 mln dlrs last year. REUTER 
ECUADOR TO USE COLOMBIA OIL LINK FOR FIVE YEARS

Ecuador will use a new pipeline link with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years, Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said. The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5 by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline, Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said. The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling will begin in September. "The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only for this emergency period but for the next five years, with possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) will be pumped along it," Perry said. Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents per barrel during the first year. The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the Pacific port of Tumaco. Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was "insignificant compared with what we are going to earn." OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln dlrs per month, Espinosa said. REUTER 
ECUADOR ECONOMY SEEN CONTRACTING IN 1987

The Ecuadorean economy, struck by an earthquake last month, will contract an estimated four pct in 1987 and its crude oil output will drop by 42 pct, the government's national development council (Conade) said. A Conade report, dated April 21 and obtained, said that the country's gross domestic product (gdp) would fall by an estimated four pct compared to 1.5 pct growth last year. Conade functions as the country's main planning institution. Crude output will fall to 61.2 mln barrels in 1987 from 105.6 mln in 1986, Conade said. It forecast exports of 22.9 mln of crude and derivatives against 63.3 mln last year. The March five earthquake killed up to 1,000 people and caused an estimated one billion dlrs in damage. It paralyzed Ecuador's crude output because it ruptured the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of jungle oilfields, to the Pacific Ocean port of Balao. It will take until at least end-July to repair the line and return output to normal levels, oil officials said. Ecuador output was about 250,000 barrels per day before the tremor. Conade forecast total 1987 exports of 1.77 billion dlrs, 572 mln dlrs of which would be oil and derivatives. Imports were forecast at 1.70 billion dlrs. Total 1986 exports were 2.18 billion dlrs, of which 979 mln dlrs were crude and derivatives, with total imports 1.66 billion dlrs. Conade predicted that payments on Ecuador's 8.16 billion dlrs foreign debt will be limited to 947 mln dlrs this year against 1.489 billion dlrs last year. Conade's projected ceiling on payments is not legally binding. The current account balance of payments deficit was seen at 934 mln dlrs in 1987. It was 696 mln dlrs in 1986. Reuter 
QATAR"S BANKS SET FOR FURTHER LEAN SPELL

Bank profits in the Gulf oil state of Qatar are coming under renewed pressure and foreign banks are retrenching further in one of the region"s most overbanked markets. Results for 1986 show a year of declining profit for several foreign banks, although locally-owned operations were in some cases able to cushion the drop by increasing market share. <Qatar National Bank SAQ>"s (QNB) General Manager, Abdulla Khalid al-Attiya, said: "The economy is not improving as we hoped... 1987 will be another difficult year for the banks." Oil-dependent Qatar, with a tiny indigenous population of 60,000 to 80,000 and an expatriate workforce estimated at about 280,000, boasts five local banks and 10 foreign bank operations. Local and foreign bankers in the capital said the Gulf-wide recession, aggravated this year by Qatar"s severe difficulty marketing its crude oil at official OPEC prices, has taken a heavy toll on the economy and bank profitability. As a result, the only U.S. Bank, <Citibank NA>, is thought to be negotiating to sell its operation to the fast growing locally based <Al Ahli Bank of Qatar QSC> which only started operations in 1984, bankers said. Citibank would not comment. Other foreign banks have retrenched, with <Standard Chartered Bank> cutting staff and others expected to follow. <Banque Paribas> is examining a change in its status to admit 51 pct Qatari ownership in a bid to improve its access to local business, bankers said. One banker added: "Weak profits are here to stay for the time being. There is no cause for optimism at the moment." Sentiment had picked up briefly at the end of last year when OPEC reached its accord to curb oil output and return to fixed prices. However, it soon became apparent that Qatar was having difficulty selling oil at OPEC prices. The soft spot oil market has left official Qatari crude prices 20 to 40 cents more expensive and sales have been running in recent weeks at 100,000 and 120,000 barrels per day, well down on the nation"s OPEC quota of 285,000, oil sources said. Bankers said this serious shortfall in Qatar"s revenue has led to a new spate of payments delays from the public sector to private contractors after a marginal improvement in January. Loan loss provisions continued to eat into bank profits last year, as did the introduction of minimum reserve requirements by the Qatar Monetary Agency. Trade financing has almost dried up as a traditional source of bank income. Of the local banks, QNB conducts the bulk of the government"s business and subsequently enjoys a huge advantage its rivals cannot expect to match, bankers said. The bank reported a 2.9 pct rise in net 1986 profit to 93.1 mln Qatari riyals, while its balance sheet grew by 10.8 pct to 9.0 billion, making it by far the largest bank in Qatar. But the strong assets growth partly reflected bridging loans for the public and private sector to tide government departments and local business over the lean economic spell, Attiya said. "Generally speaking, we are overbanked in Qatar," he said, echoing a widespread feeling in the banking community. Other local banks fared less strongly. The second largest, <Doha Bank Ltd QSC>, reported a 13 pct drop in net profit to 27.5 mln riyals, while <Commercial Bank of Qatar Ltd QSC>, registered a decline to 18.5 mln riyals from 19.4 mln in 1985. The newcomer Al Ahli Bank, continued to expand rapidly and reported net profit of 5.2 mln compared with 3.3 mln during the start-up period from August 4, 1984 to end-1985. Bankers said the local banks had clearly begun to win commercial deposits previously held by foreign banks, increasing already strong pressure on non-Qatari banks to reexamine their staffing levels and overheads. <Grindlays Bank PLC> recorded a net loss at its Doha branch last year of 4.7 mln riyals after registering a nominal profit in 1985 of 12,000 riyals. Two other long-established banks in the Gulf, the <British Bank of the Middle East> (BBME) and Standard Chartered, also found last year a difficult climate to make strong profits. BBME"s net profit fell to 3.2 mln riyals from 10.4 mln in 1985, but Assistant Manager John Farquharson said 1985"s result had been artificially inflated by tax rebates on provisions. "Foreign banks are seeing their assets decline, while local banks are increasing their market share," Farquharson said. BBME"s operating profit was steady in 1986, edging up to 12.3 mln riyals from 11.5 mln in 1985. "We are expecting the same level of operating profit in 1987," Farquharson said. Standard Chartered"s net profit last year recovered slightly to 1.6 mln riyals after a loss of 161,000 in 1985. Staff numbers were cut last year to reduce overheads. Bankers said the lack of new construction projects in Qatar means business is unlikely to pick up this year although hopes are rising that the start of Qatari gas exploitation could provide a boost. But the threat of higher U.S. Interest rates may erode bank deposits as savings are moved offshore. REUTER 
WORLD OIL DEMAND LIKELY TO INCREASE, SUBROTO SAYS

Oil prices have stabilized in world markets and demand is likely to increase in the second half of the year, Indonesia's Mines and Energy Minister Subroto said. He told a meeting of oil industry executives that oil prices had stabilized at 18 dlrs a barrel -- the average fixed price OPEC put into effect in February -- and supply and demand have been in equilibrium since March. If OPEC does not increase overall output in the second half of the year, prices will tend to increase, because non-OPEC producers have not been able to produce more oil at current prices, he said. But he declined to predict, when asked after the meeting, whether OPEC would raise its production ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels at its next meeting in June. He said in his speech that world oil production over the last two months was estimated at 45.6 mln barrels a day, or two mln barrels a day less than world oil demand. Oil production by industrialized countries, particularly the U.S. And Canada, is expected to decrease this year, but some of that slack will be taken up by increased production in Cameroon, India and other developing countries, he said. This year is a battle between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers and consumers in the industrialized world for the upper hand in world oil markets, Subroto said in an earlier speech to management trainees at Pertamina Oil Company. "If OPEC emerges the winner, than it can gradually resume its former role in world oil markets," he said. "But don't expect oil prices to return to the level of 28-30 dlrs a barrel, at least not in the next three or four years," Subroto said. REUTER 

SAUDIS NOT SEEKING OIL PRICE ABOVE 18 DLRS - MEES

Saudi Arabia will not seek to push OPEC oil prices above the current benchmark of 18 dlrs per barrel unless oil demand grows strongly, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said. The Cyprus-based weekly newsletter quoted authoritative Saudi sources as saying the Kingdom's oil price policy would not change "unless and until there is a strong revival in the growth of demand for oil." MEES said this contradicted recent hints of new Saudi price hawkishness from U.S. Congressional and oil industry sources. The Saudi sources said their policy was firmly based on the long-term need to restore the competitive position of oil in general and OPEC oil in particular against other energy sources. "Saudi Arabia is certainly committed to cooperating with its OPEC partners to exercise the necessary production restraint to maintain the 18 dlr per barrel reference price level," MEES said. The newsletter said Saudi output in the first three weeks of April averaged slightly above its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd). Output would fall in the last week, causing the month's average to be below quota, MEES said. MEES estimated overall OPEC production for April at around 16.8-16.9 mln bpd -- two mln bpd more than both its figures for March and Reuter estimates for March. It said Iranian production had risen by 500,000 bpd this month to 2.2-2.3 mln bpd, around its quota level. In Iraq, with an OPEC-assigned quota of 1.466 mln bpd, output rose this month to two mln bpd, not including "war relief" supplies from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the newsletter said. Nigeria, which has had problems selling its full 1.238 mln bpd entitlement, increased its output to 1.2 mln bpd, it added. REUTER 
INDIA PLANS MORE BOMBAY OFFSHORE OIL WELLS

India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombay offshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave both oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said. The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres, yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas per day, he said. "The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80 km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil and gas. We've decided to drill at least three more wells in there before starting production on a commercial scale." Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the last two years. ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending March, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accounted for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before. India's total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes. ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay High has reached a plateau.

COMPROMISE SEEN LIKELY OVER CONOCO-STATOIL DISPUTE

Norway is expected to seek a compromise solution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S <STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm will operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said. The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the field's operator through the development phase, with Statoil taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s. Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision had been taken and several questions remained unresolved. It was unlikely the government would announce its decision on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies, the sources added. This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by Conoco. Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as the most likely candidate for the first field development project on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central Norway. Reuter 

It does not approve of a decrease in prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and find alternative sources (for energy)." OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system aimed to stabilise the market around 18 dlrs a barrel. OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it will review its current oil price and production policy. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil prices to remain stable for the next two years.

LUKMAN SEES STABLE OIL PRICE FOR NEXT COUPLE YEARS

The current crude oil price of between 18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next couple of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said. Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government officials said. They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third World debt and industrialised nations. Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said. Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he said. This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high prices, he added. Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled. REUTER 

COLOMBIAN GROUP SUSPENDS BOMBINGS OF PIPELINES

A Colombian group announced the suspension of its bombings of oil pipelines pending the government's levy of a social tax on foreign petroleum companies and an 800 mln dlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY>. There was no indication the government would meet the conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army (ELN). According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986. The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage. In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults. Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion. If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up to 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the penalty. Reuter 
EC WATCHING GULF WAR DEVELOPMENTS

The European Community (EC) should watch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and their consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner Nicolas Mosar said today. Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the Gulf, Mosar warned, "An escalation in the Gulf would increase tensions in the oil market." "But I do not want to be alarmist," he told a news conference after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg. He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last year. "There are also other potential sources of supplies in the world," he added. The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the ministers' meeting, he added. A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual meeting on June 19, he said. But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC foreign ministers, diplomats said. West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil supplies.

OPEC OFFICIAL SAYS CARTEL HAS REGAINED LEADERSHIP

OPEC has regained its former role as price-setter in the oil market following last year's price war, acting OPEC Secretary General Fadhil al-Chalabi said. But he said he expects no short-term rise in demand for OPEC oil, adding that market stability will mean a continued sacrifice for the 13 OPEC member countries. Al-Chalabi, speaking at a university here yesterday, said the December 1986 conference at which OPEC set an 18 dlr per barrel reference price gave the market a signal that the producers' group was serious. "It (OPEC) has no choice but to defend the price and this has restored its credibility," said al-Chalabi, who is in Caracas for a meeting of the OPEC Fund Board of Governors. Al-Chalabi said OPEC members have not exceeded the production quotas which took effect on February 1 and spot market prices are now near or above official OPEC prices. Before the December conference OPEC faced a major and basic dilemma which led to the loss of its leadership role, he said. "The question was, what should OPEC do? Defend the price and risk losing its market share? Or defend its market share and let the price drop?" he asked. "OPEC has chosen to stabilise the price. But the question is how long will it be willing to keep up this painful exercise?" he said. Al-Chalabi said that despite OPEC's success in shoring up prices and achieving discipline regarding quotas, he saw no quick end to restraint in production. He also said he foresaw no increase in demand for OPEC oil because increased non-OPEC production, combined with conservation and the use of alternative energy sources, has caused changes in the market which will not easily be reversed.

Australian crude oil and condensate output fell 7.6 pct to 23,480 megalitres, or about 147 mln barrels, in the first nine months of fiscal 1986/87 ending June 30, the Department of Resources and Energy said. The decline in production in the nine months to end-March reflected mainly a sharp dip early in the fiscal year, when low oil prices and high marginal excise rates led to a reduction of output from Bass Strait, department figures in its Major Energy Statistics publication show.

SRI LANKA PLANS TO RENEW ABU DHABI OIL CONTRACT

Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has decided to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000 tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials told Reuters. They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is now awaiting its approval. CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31 this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1 at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each. CPC officials also said the company agreed with the Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the government selling price. Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through C.Itoh. Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments. Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each. CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable. CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln tonnes.

Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco. Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167 billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985, while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said. Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier. Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the organisation decided to cut production again from last September onwards. Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s. Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the official Saudi Press Agency. The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985. Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44 mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the report said. The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced around 750,000 bpd last year. Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from 998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day, the report said. Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4 billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs. REUTER 
OPEC PRESIDENT LUKMAN EXPECTS SHORT, CALM MEETING

OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman said he expects next week's ministerial meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review. "I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm," Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which starts June 25. "We already have an agreement which may need only a slight review," Lukman said. The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel. Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement to keep the market stable. "I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to strengthen the gains we have made so far," Lukman said. He declined to say if the current ceiling should be maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and 18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December. "Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our collective will to keep the market strong," he said. He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this was significant for its members. Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year when OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and a restocking now for the winter was responsible for current market strength. Reuter 

SAUDI OIL COMPANY GETS NEW ACTING GOVERNOR

The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has retired at his own request, oil industry sources said. They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor. Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher, left in a major oil industry shake up last December. The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the post permanently. The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil market. The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20 years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut. Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel last December. Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia does business, the sources said. The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi, Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic Port. REUTER 

UAE Oil Minister Mana Said al-Oteiba arrived in Alexandria last night for a visit to Egypt, the national Middle East News Agency (MENA) said. It said Oteiba, who had just attended the OPEC ministerial meeting in Vienna, would stay for several days but gave no details. Non-OPEC Egypt has pledged to restrain output to support OPEC's moves to boost oil prices.

NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY

Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15 until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle told Reuters. "We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna," he said. "The accord reached there means stability in the oil market and we shall continue making our contribution." The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts. OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth quarter. Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained within its December accord on output and prices. Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995. The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd. Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks. Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep prices stable. Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December. Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986. But firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit. Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to the producing oil companies to set the levels of production. REUTER 
EXTRACTS FROM OPEC COMMUNIQUE

Following are extracts from the communique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference here. "The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18 dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings distributed into national production levels. "The conference noted that all market indicators, including spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement." "The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the second half of the year and decided that in order to secure continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into the same national production levels as were defined by the above-mentioned agreement for that quarter." "Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices in order to secure price stability around the opec price structure. "Should there be any significant change in market prices, the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the year, which would secure the desired market stability." "The conference reiterated the necessity of member countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December 1986, both in terms of official price, and national production, levels. "For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the terms of the agreement." "Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market stability. The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group of five heads of delegation established by the 77th (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to undertake the necessary contacts with those countries. "The conference observed the continued fall in the value of the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied and reported to the next meeting of the conference." "The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next ordinary meeting. "The conference extended the term of office of Fadhil al-Chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year from October 7, 1987. "The next ordinary meeting of the conference will be convened in Vienna on December 9, 1987." REUTER 
KUWAIT SEES OPEC OUTPUT OVER CEILING TO END-YEAR

OPEC output for the second half of 1987, including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday, Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said. Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter target. Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, "OPEC third quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd" Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices. Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd, rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September. Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369 mln in the second half. Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. "We will not discuss it. There will not be any change," he said. Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed. "We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet," he said. Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting. Ali said "The problem of differentials is a real one. I would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes." Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said "If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do the work of another minister." Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades. OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes. Reuter 
IRAQ REJECTS NEW OPEC OIL QUOTA

Iraq has rejected its new OPEC production quota set in Vienna for the second half of this year, the official Iraqi news agency INA reported. It quoted Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, who returned Sunday, as saying "Iraq will continue to adhere to its position considering itself as not included in the agreement." Last December, Iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987 quota of 1.466 mln bpd and demanded a share equal to the 2.255 mln bpd quota set for Iran, its enemy in the nearly seven-year-old Gulf war. The accord reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna Saturday set an output ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd for the group's 13 members from July to December, raising Iraq's share to 1.54 mln bpd and Iran's to 2.369 mln.

ECUADOR TO PRODUCE ABOVE OPEC QUOTA - MINISTER

Ecuador will produce crude oil in excess of its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this year, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news conference. Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to 320,000 bpd next January, the minister said. "We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to produce during the past few months," he said. Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean production from March to May this year. Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved. "They understood our position and we believe we remain within the spirit of the (quota) agreement," he said. Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported. While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four mln barrels of products, Santos said. Reuter 
VENEZUELA BUDGET SEES 16.35 DLRS OIL PRICE

Venezuela's government tomorrow presents a 1988 budget proposal for 183.432 billion bolivars, based upon an oil price of 16.35 dlrs per barrel, finance minister Manuel Azpurua said. Azpurua told reporters after a cabinet meeting the new budget projects ordinary income of 149.925 billion bolivars and extraordinary income of 34.186 billion. Oil revenues are expected to produce 92.014 billion, or 61 pct of the total. The finance minister said the oil revenue projection is based on an average price of 16.35 dlrs per barrel in 1988. Venezuelan oil through the first half of 1987 has averaged 16. 20 dlrs per barrel, according to the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. Reuter 
MALAYSIA ADVISED TO RAISE CRUDE OIL OUTPUT IN 1988

WORLD COULD COPE WITH HORMUZ CLOSURE, SUBROTO SAYS

Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military action in the Gulf. But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian Petroleum Association, he said, "If worst comes to worst and say the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust, can take care of the situation." "But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of the situation," he declared. Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively short-term impact on prices, he added. Assessing future price trends, he said, "Short-term spot prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per barrel. "The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater than the downward ones." "The balance between supply and demand in the short term will still be delicate," he added. "Non-Opec production may still go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase in world demand." Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers. In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he said. REUTER 
INDONESIA FINDS NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS RESOURCES

The Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East Aceh, on the western tip of northern Sumatra, a company spokesman said. The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1 offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh. "Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300 metres within the Baong formation," he said. He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at 20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke. "The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln standard cubic feet a day," he added. GOS IA-1 well, located at a water depth of 41 metres, was drilled under a production sharing contract between Pertamina and Japex North Sumatra Ltd, each having 50 pct shares. "Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as operator through a joint operating body established by the two companies," the Pertamina spokesman stated. The contract covers the Gebang block contract area. The two companies have previously completed the drilling of GOS IIA-1 exploratory well, around 14 kms south of GOS IA-1. REUTER 
INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS

Indonesia told the oil industry on Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return. President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas. "In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws," Suharto said. "Apart from that, the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry," he said. Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration. "As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully aware of this situation," Subroto said. "The government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a selective basis." Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil industry sources say. Subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions. But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered. President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated. Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in 1986. Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies. Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority. There had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas, such as when a field is designated commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made. He said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive. Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years. "This need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement." Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said. Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted. Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective, based on how much capital would be invested. REUTER 
NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER

Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2 pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here. Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field rescue project. Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets. Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all its North Sea fields for the rest of the year. Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth. The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August, field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said. Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence. BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown. Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company said. September production was also sharply higher at the Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said. Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said. Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd in September, compared with 100,188 in August. Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in August. Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on stream a second well, cutting September production to just two days. REUTER 

SOVIET 1988 OIL OUTPUT TARGET AT 625 MLN TONNES

The Soviet oil production target for 1988 has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over this year's planned output. Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament. He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation which began in late 1983. Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil, slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln. January-September figures released at the weekend showed Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467 mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million. Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry. The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988 budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday. REUTER 

VENEZUELA BACKS INCREASE IN ECUADOR OPEC QUOTA

Venezuela will back Ecuador's bid to raise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd) because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday. He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an earthquake last March. "For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise its right to produce 221,000 bpd," he said. "We should recognize Ecuador's right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of justice in that country's petition." He added however, the quota increase should be gradual to avoid harming the market, he added. Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna.

MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity. The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms east of North Yemen's Alif oilfield.

KUWAITI OIL EXPORTS SAID NOT AFFECTED BY GULF WAR

Kuwait's oil exports have not been affected by the seven-year Iran-Iraq war, Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC) Chairman and Managing Director Abdul Fattah al-Bader told a Kuwaiti newspaper. "Kuwait has exploited all available opportunities to continue exporting its oil without any reduction," the Al-Anbaa newspaper quoted him as saying. He said KOTC made profits of more than two mln dinars (seven mln dlrs) in the fiscal year ending last June, but predicted lower profits this year due to higher costs for chartering and operating vessels.

STATOIL PLACES NORTH SEA VESLEFRIKK FIELD ORDERS

Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) <STAT.OL>, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field, has placed field development contracts totalling 1.5 billion crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a statement. Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier A/S <KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said. Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S <AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig. Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several months earlier than previously planned. Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km west of Bergen. Statoil estimates the field's total development cost, including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas. Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields. Partners on the field are Statoil, the operator, with a 55 pct share, <Unocal Norge A/S> (18 pct), <Deminex (Norge) A/S> (13.5 pct), Norsk Hydro A/S <NHY.OL> (nine pct) and <Svenska Petroleum AB> (4.5 pct).

IRAN, SOVIET UNION TO SWAP CRUDE, REFINED PRODUCTS

The Soviet Union has agreed to supply Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels per day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said. IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said. Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union. Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf. Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he left for Moscow. Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined products. Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran. REUTER 

INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW

Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report. Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia"s agricultural performance. The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987. The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks. "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain," the report says. "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels." Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines. The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types. The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says. But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand. The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984. The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump. REUTER 
CHINESE WHEAT CROP THREATENED BY PESTS, DISEASE

China's wheat crop this year is seriously threatened by plant pests and diseases, the New China News Agency said. More than 5 mln hectares of wheat-producing land in North China could be affected because relatively warm and dry weather had allowed bacteria and insect eggs to survive the winter, the agency added.

OFFICIAL INQUIRY SET FOR AUSTRALIAN WHEAT INDUSTRY

The government's industry aid and protection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said. The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid, he said in a statement. He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire. Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system. "The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes," he said. "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry, as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time," he said. Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season. The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, Kerin said. He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry.

EAST EUROPE WHEAT WINTERKILL POSSIBLE, ACCU SAYS

Winter wheat crops in the western Soviet Union, Poland and eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania may suffer some winterkill over the next two nights, private forecaster Accu-Weather Inc said. Western USSR winter wheat areas have had only light and spotty snow and winterkill is possible tonight and tomorrow night as temperatures drop to minus 10 to 0 degrees F. Snow cover is scant in Poland, with only about 50 pct of the winter wheat areas reporting one to two inches of snow as of this morning. The remaining 50 pct of winter wheat crops do not have snow cover, making winterkill possible on each of the next two nights. Lowest temperatures will be minus 10 to 0 degrees F. Winter wheat areas from eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania had light snow flurries yesterday and last night, but amounts were an inch or less. With temperatures expected to fall to near 0 degrees F over the next two nights, some light winterkill is possible, Accu-Weather added. Reuter 
FRENCH EXPORTERS SEE HIGHER WHEAT SALES TO CHINA

French exporters estimated that around 600,000 tonnes of French soft wheat has been sold to China for delivery in the 1986/87 (July/June) year. Around 300,000 tonnes were exported to China between July 1986 and February this year. Another 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes will be shipped during this month and around the same amount in April, they said. France sold around 250,000 tonnes of soft wheat to China in 1985/86, according to customs figures. However, certain exporters fear China may renounce part of its contract with France after being offered one mln tonnes of U.S. soft wheat under the Export Enhancement Program in January and making some purchases under the initiative.

EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE

The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission sources said. The ministers agreed that under this "extensification" scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct. The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and wine, they added. Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case, farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC. The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego. The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment. It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such allowances are available only for livestock. The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques, the sources added. At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers. Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state aid would be subject to "strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition." EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production. The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay "early retirement" pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production. Those who took their land completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to their heirs, would have received more generous payments. Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed. Reuter 
FROST NOT EXPECTED TO DAMAGE POLAND'S WHEAT

Poland's winter wheat is likely to survive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be known until late April, the Polish meteorology institute said. Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive ground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C, Spokesman Teresa Tomaszewska told Reuters. Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly melted in February, air temperatures down to minus 30 C should not be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still be damaged by cold spells in March and April, when young shoots may be exposed to night frosts.

TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST

Torrential rains throughout Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May. The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year's harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to official figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area. Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure of 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest. Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86. Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes. Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures. Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares. Reuter 
IZVESTIA SAYS SOVIET WINTER CROPS NEED RESEEDING

The government daily Izvestia said a considerable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseeded and the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will not be easy to fulfil. Without giving figures, the newspaper said: "A considerable part of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates extra effort in the fields in spring." The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill. A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in 10 years. "The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes of grain is not simple," Izvestia said. This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the Ukraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low as minus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.

ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC

The size of French 1986/87 carryover barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said. He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the end of February from the previous month while export forecasts were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86. Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are opened for French barley a large amount could be put into intervention. A small amount of French barley has already been put into intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount. The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000 tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in 1985/86. The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said. Reuter 

The package of proposed farm policy changes that the Reagan administration sent to Congress today includes a provision that would eliminate minimum price support levels for upland cotton, rice and soybeans. The package, obtained by Reuters, also includes a provision, outlined in advance by USDA officials, that would increase the annual permissible cut in the basic price support levels for all major crops to 10 pct from five pct. Under current law, the basic support prices for upland cotton, rice and soybeans between 1987 and 1990 cannot be cut below 50 cents per lb, 6.50 dlrs per hundredweight and 4.50 dlrs per bushel, respectively. USDA's intention to propose scrapping price floors for cotton, rice and soybeans had not been disclosed previously. Reuter 
UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA'S AGRICULTURE

Abnormally warm and dry weather over most parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News Agency said. It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing areas, it said. The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than seven months. The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March, lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and consumers. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said. The drought has also increased the number of forest fires. More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340 hectares of forest by mid-February, it said. REUTER 
THAILAND REDUCES MAIN RICE CROP PROJECTION

Thailand's main paddy crop is expected to fall to 15.4 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 (Nov/Oct) season from a previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35 mln a year ago, the Thai Rice Mills Association said. It said a joint field survey late last month by the association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces. The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of 1986. It said last November that the drought reduced total national areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares this year, down from 8.84 mln a year ago.

BRAZIL SUSPENDS IMPORT OF 500,000 TONNES MAIZE

Brazil has suspended the importation of 500,000 tonnes of maize ordered last year because of the excellent domestic maize harvest expected this year, Agriculture Minister Iris Resende said. The Agriculture Ministry expects a record maize crop of 27.7 mln tonnes, a 36 pct increase on last year's crop of 20.3 mln tonnes. Brazil's total grain crop is expected to be 65.3 mln tonnes. "This is a record in the history of Brazilian agriculture," a ministry spokesman said. Resende announced suspension of the maize imports at a news conference in Brasilia yesterday. The ministry spokesman said he had no other details on the maize transaction. Reuter 
ARGENTINA-BRAZIL TRADE JUMPED 90 PCT IN 1986

Trade between Argentina and Brazil jumped 90 pct in 1986 versus 1985, Foreign Minister Dante Caputo said. Speaking to reporters, Caputo said the near doubling in trade showed the "tangible and immediate results" of a wide- ranging economic integration accord signed by the presidents of both countries last July. He said trade last year totalled 1.3 billion dlrs versus 700 mln dlrs in 1985. The accord provided for capital goods trade between the two countries to rise to 2.0 billion dlrs over four years. Argentine wheat exports to Brazil will increase from 1,375,000 tonnes in 1987 to 2.0 mln tonnes in 1991, the accord said. Reuter 
ARGENTINA UNAFFECTED BY BRAZIL'S MAIZE DECISION

A government official said that a decision by Brazil not to import maize because it forecast a record harvest would not affect Argentina's exports. "We have heard nothing about this, but if Brazil has decided not to import maize that is no problem for us as it is not one of our main customers," Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Under-Secretary Miguel Braceras said. Private sources also said Argentina's exports would not be affected by Brazil's decision, which Agriculture Minister Iris Resende announced yesterday in Sao Paulo. Brazil had not asked for any Argentine maize, they said. They also said a smaller crop and adverse weather this summer in Argentina had reduced production. Braceras said that last year Brazil bought 800,000 tonnes of Argentine maize but in some years it had not imported any from Argentina. The Soviet Union was Argentina's main customer and Japan was also becoming a bigger importer of the country's maize, he said. Reuter 
CHINA RAISES CROP PRICES TO INCREASE OUTPUT

China has raised the prices it pays farmers for cotton, edible oil, sugar cane and beets to reverse a decline in output in 1986, He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries said. The China Daily quoted He as saying China should adopt intensive farming to increase per hectare output and improve crop quality and maintain arable land at 111 mln hectares. He gave no details of the price increases. On grain, He said the state will cut the quota it purchases from farmers by 50 mln tonnes and abolish the practice of purchasing through agents. He said the state will increase investment in agriculture and supplies of fertiliser, diesel oil and other production materials and stabilise fertiliser and diesel oil prices. The state offers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance to farmers who contract to supply grain at a low state-fixed price. He said China aims to produce between 425 and 450 mln tonnes of grain by 1990, up from a target of 405 mln this year and an actual 391 mln last year. He gave no more details. REUTER 

SICHUAN BRACED TO FIGHT DROUGHT

The Sichuan government has ordered that any work or meeting which interferes with the fight against drought must be cancelled or postponed to save time, energy and manpower, the People's Daily domestic edition said. Sichuan is one of six provinces threatened by drought. Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily, said the drought, the worst for more than 20 years, is affecting nearly two mln hectares in 100 counties in Sichuan, the country's biggest agricultural producer. Sichuan has experienced temperatures three degrees Centigrade higher than normal and rainfall up to 70 pct less than normal since early February, affecting wheat, oil-bearing crops, rice planting and dryland cash crops, it said. The paper said 43,000 hectares in Meixian county in Guangdong are seriously short of water. The People's Daily said Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hebei are also suffering from drought. Henan's grain output fell by 2.5 mln tonnes last year from the 1985 level because of drought which has been affecting the province since May. REUTER 

MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS

Heavy rains fell again in Argentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces. Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires, heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe. Rainfall was lighter in other provinces. Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to 31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco. Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered. Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate. The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm. Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares, Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area. Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that 200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low-lying and flood easily. Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants. The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct a week ago. Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather. Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mln tonnes. Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2 mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a week ago. Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes, according to official figures. Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln tonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures. Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching between four and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to four pct a week ago. Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest. Reuter 

Taiwan's maize import commitments are expected to rise to 970,000 tonnes in the first four months of 1987 from 870,000 tonnes a year earlier, a spokesman for the Joint Committee of Maize Importers told Reuters. He said more than 75 pct of the imports come from the U.S. And the rest from South Africa.

AWB SAYS AUSTRALIAN WHEAT SALES OVER 10 MLN TONNES

The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB) 1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes already sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said. "We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export target for the year," he said in a statement. He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the Soviet Union and Iraq. In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes. Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered to the AWB. The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said. However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said. Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's February Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes. But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes. The official estimate is not yet available. In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of the 16.13 mln tonne crop. Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000 sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB's receival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics data.

PORTUGAL GRAIN AGENCY BARRED FROM IMPORT TENDERS

A Portuguese court has made a preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders open to private importers, grain traders and officials said. Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs. The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders. Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civil court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders. Trade sources said the ruling, though effective immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings. A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn. Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly. It also said the participation of EPAC, which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network, was unfair competition to the private traders. Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue. "They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile," one trader said. ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if necessary. Reuter 

CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987

China's grain imports will rise in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and Japanese traders told Reuters. They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982. An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73 mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985. Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports, which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985. "China is short of foreign exchange," the Shanghai official said. "We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer." A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought, low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption. "At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs," the trader said. The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year's level. The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986. "All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and high-yield cash crops," it said. It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought. Since January, the press has devoted much attention to grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low. Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output. The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70,000 workers available to help farmers. Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits. Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province. "In addition, we are setting up grain production bases, raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other infrastructure," he said. The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases, they lease the land to grain farmers. The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made profitable. "The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption. Only this will boost enthusiasm," it said. REUTER 

ZIMBABWE MAIZE OUTPUT TO FALL 65 PCT

Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe's state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65 pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agricultural industry sources said. They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to around 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60 pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial farmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers. Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries since 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a food shortage in Zimbabwe. While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000 tonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes, which means that even with the sharply reduced production this year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years. The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a 25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from 248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean deliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986.

ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL

Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in mid-February. But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7 pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures, and would be a new record. The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year. The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province. The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty, especially in Cordoba. Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas. Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces. With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize, sunflower and sorghum harvesting. Crops were considered in generally good condition, though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long-term damage. The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago. Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest. Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest, according to official figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago. Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record 3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. The current harvest's volume was again expected to be between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than last harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes. Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and, consequently, on total production volume. The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago. Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and 1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest. Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to 22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. Reuter 

EC TO ABOLISH TAX ON SPANISH MAIZE EXPORTS

The European Community Commission has decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne imposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said. They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC and non-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exports from Spanish ports south of Valencia. The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority's cereals management committee today. The tax had been introduced last September at the same time as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports of maize to Spain from other EC member countries. The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from being reexported back to them. The sources added that Spain had received no answer from the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the sale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize. The request will be considered at the committee's next meeting, the commission sources said. Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of maize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS

Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino weather pattern, <Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weather forecasting service, said. Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government officials and meteorologists said. Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months. Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added. Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for over 20 years, the paper said. The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers, it added. This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causing shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said. Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February. The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984. Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia, concern is growing about below-average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, local Meteorological Bureau officials said. For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added. Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino, they said. Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single cause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said. Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event' was unique. The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982/83, it said. El Nino, Spanish for "Christ Child" because it appears around Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds, meteorologists said. The winds, strengthened by El Nino's "pump" effect, raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said. When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said. One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns. The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather said. China, where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the May-September rains, it said. The May-September rains normally provide the drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall. In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end. In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usually occur between April and June, although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual. REUTER 
INDIA DETAILS RAIN/FLOOD DAMAGE TO GRAIN IN 1986

Rain and floods in India last year damaged about 69,000 tonnes of grain intended for human consumption during storage and transportation, food and civil supplies minister H. K. L. Bhagat told Parliament. He did not give comparative figures and said the government-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI) had not yet decided whether these grains could be used as cattle feed. Bhagat said the FCI had a total of 16.43 mln tonnes of food grains in its warehouses at the end of 1986. It had asked state governments to build more warehouses to avoid damage to grains. REUTER 

DENG SETS LIMIT TO CHINA GRAIN IMPORTS, PAPER SAYS

China's top leader Deng Xiaoping said China must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain, Ming Pao newspaper of Hong Kong said. Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes of grain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record 16.15 mln in 1982. The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is one of several key issues that will influence the whole development of the economy. It did not give the context of his remarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from 391 mln in 1986. The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has reached the point where "pigs are not fed, there is not enough grain and increases in output have slowed." "We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by the year 2000," he said. "We must avoid the situation in recent years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain." The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has decided to raise the price of five grains, including corn and rice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details. REUTER 
BANGLADESH FORECASTS GDP GROWTH OF 4.4 PCT

Gross domestic product is expected to grow by 4.4 pct in the year ending June 30, Finance Minister Mohammad Syeduzzaman told reporters. Inflation fell to an estimated 12 pct this fiscal year from 17 pct in 1981/82, he said last night. The World Bank and other independent sources have said inflation would be around 15 pct in 1986/87. Syeduzzaman said remittances from expatriates would rise to 600 mln dlrs this year from 425 mln in 1981/82. Foreign exchange reserves at end-June are projected at 680 mln dlrs compared with 105 mln in 1981/82, he said. Syeduzzaman said the export target has been set at 900 mln dlrs this year against 626 mln in 1981/82. Commitments for foreign loans and grants total more than five billion dlrs in 1986/87, against 3.54 billion five years previously, he said. The government's liberal industrial policy has attracted investment commitments totalling 250 mln dlrs, he said Foodgrain output is estimated at 16.4 mln tonnes this year, up from 16.12 mln in 1985/86 and 14.4 mln in 1981/82. Government officials have said Bangladesh must import nearly two mln tonnes of grain annually up to 1990, when the government expects to attain self-sufficiency in food. REUTER 
AUSTRALIAN WHEAT AREA TO FALL, FORECASTER SAYS

Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72 mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF) said in its first preliminary crop forecast. But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year, the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season. Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said. The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average, AWF said. Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops. "The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers' income," AWF said. AWF's state area forecasts in mln hectares, with 1986/87 production in mln tonnes, are as follows (crop forecasts were not given for the new wheat year) Area Crop 1987/88 1986/87 1986/87 Queensland 0.82 0.82 0.95 N.S.W. 3.07 3.17 4.40 Victoria 1.53 1.63 3.25 S.Australia 1.45 1.64 2.30 W.Australia 3.53 4.46 5.60 REUTER 
RAINS PROMISE BOUNTIFUL CROPS IN ETHIOPIA

Rain over wide areas has raised the prospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffered a disastrous drought and famine two years ago. Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's Agriculture Development Department, told reporters prospects were good for attaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the present growing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia. Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnes a year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the "belg" (small) rains which fall at this time of year. The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like maize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affects production in the main rainy season, because farmers eat their stocks of seed. Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regions which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow their crops because of the favourable rains. The government had distributed large quantities of seed and fertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop. Reuter 

TRADE PROPOSES NEW EC GRAIN INTERVENTION RULES

The European Community (EC) cereals trade lobby organisation Coceral said it has written to EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen to propose a new system for sales into intervention, which it claims could save the EC budget money. It proposes that applications for intervention be made through a certificate valid for execution three months later. If during the three months the trader found a market elsewhere, he could buy back the certificate on payment of a one pct premium. Coceral argues that this would restore the original function of intervention as a safety net and would end the present situation in which produce is often sold into intervention as a precaution.

PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER

Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders. Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders. Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done, in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports. As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize. Barreto said, "My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part." He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders. Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator, whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them. "There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system," Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had accepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible. The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

CHINA SAYS POSSIBLE GOOD HARVEST DESPITE DROUGHT

China's summer grain harvest may be good despite a serious drought because the State Council (cabinet) has spent one billion yuan on irrigation and other anti-drought work, a Hong Kong newspaper said. Wen Hui Bao said the drought, which has affected Shanxi, Hebei, Henan and Shandong the most, has eased with March rains in south China and March snowfall in the north and as some new irrigation projects have come into use. "If the drought does not worsen, there is hope for a bumper harvest," it quoted experts of the Ministry of Electric Power as saying. They gave no figures. The 1986 summer grain harvest was a record 93 mln tonnes, up from 92 mln in 1985, out of a total 1986 grain harvest of 391 mln. The 1987 target is 405 mln. REUTER 

Western agricultural attaches in Moscow said they had no evidence to substantiate rumours that last April's Chernobyl nuclear disaster had a worse effect on Soviet grain than first reported. Current Soviet interest in chartering ships to carry grain from the U.S. Helped prompt the rumours on world markets. But the diplomats said they had seen no reports in the state press and heard no comments from officials to substantiate them.

EC COLD AID FOOD SCHEME MAY BE MADE PERMANENT

Emergency action to distribute European Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a permanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said. Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores between January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved the scheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures. The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnes of sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, has been distributed to the needy through charities. The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to help poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winter and will end on March 31. But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system. The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units (72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers. However, commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates. On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on EC food surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals. Reuter 

ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER

Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87 soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April, trade sources said. They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes forecast in mid-February. The new forecast is still higher than last season's record total production. Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1 mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates. Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires. The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86 record of 3.34 mln hectares. The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm. Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates. The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts. In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged. The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios. The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares in 1985/86. The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes. This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes. The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods. A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields. The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln tonnes. The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown. The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season. Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to 22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. Reuter 

DUTCH GRAIN LEVY TEST CASE TO START IN APRIL

A large Dutch animal feed compounder will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied, a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association, Het Comite, told Reuters. Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and, since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the Business Appeal Court in The Hague. The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country. Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain commodity board. The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration Court in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10. The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged "because the bill (the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from a wide variety of origins." The name of the company is not being made public. The Administration Court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal Court in Luxembourg, and "as a result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved." Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is collected, the spokesman said. Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association of European animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actions protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court. Reuter 

FRANCE WILL FIGHT EC FARM PROPOSALS - MINISTER

French Agricultural Minister Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these markets. The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here. "I give you my word that France, while it will not reject technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply in the negative to these bad reforms," Guillaume told the annual conference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles). Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88. Relations between the government and farmers have become strained in France in recent months. There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and further cutbacks in Community milk output. But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the FNSEA's farmers. His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary Compensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoid further protests by producers. Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm sector. "The Minister's proposals back up our determination to organise union action in the coming weeks," he told reporters, adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a ministerial level. Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being appointed farm minister last spring. Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister. There have been certain advances on cutting production costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but there are still areas where more could be done such as on farmers' indebtedness, he said. Guillaume told the conference the government will make available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire. The government has already announced financial aid for the milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package announced today was new aid, Lacombe said. Reuter 

SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID

Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said. Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts. The letter said the government had to step in "to avert serious economic hardship" and because the Social Services Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas. The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk. In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been "almost completely devastated," the letter said. Maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally expected. There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks. "Should the present drought continue, however, production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels," the letter added. Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985. The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed. It said the government's current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected. "Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side." The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family, as well as handling, transport and distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects, or "greatly fuelling inflation" in the economy, the letter said. The letter said the Food Department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements "provided such stocks are replaced subsequently." The Meteorological Department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late May. The letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since August, and in the rice growing district of Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986. Reuter 

Some 840,000 hectares of farmland have been planted with cash crops including sugar cane, peanuts and soybeans, 67,000 ha more than in 1986. The provincial government has increased investment in grain and taken effective measures to combat natural disasters this year, the agency said, but gave no further details. REUTER 
IVORY COAST BOOSTS MAIZE OUTPUT

Ivory Coast maize output has risen steadily during the last two decades and the country aims to produce two mln tonnes annually "very rapidly," the official daily Fraternite Matin reported. It said the country reached self-sufficiency in maize three years ago and harvested a record 530,000 tonnes in 1985 compared with only 200,000 tonnes 20 years earlier. The daily did not detail 1986 output but said further production increases are anticipated in the years ahead as part of a policy of boosting domestic output to cut grain imports. Reuter 

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND

"If we go on using up farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on." Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes. China has to feed one quarter of the world's population, but only one seventh of its land is arable. Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in 1986. But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them. Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years. "We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began," official Xu said. "Since then, nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up." "Last year we lost land to a new railway line," Xu said. But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses, she added. The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year. "The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully, wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious," said an article in the official press explaining the new measures. "It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland," it said. "China has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient." An official of the Shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must be approved by the city government. The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making it more profitable for them to grow other crops. To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it. Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices. Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too much to the demands of "selfish city people" and could raise city grain prices without any problem. But the government has ruled out a price rise. "Raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability," said a China Daily editorial this month. The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term. "We must be very careful. We have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises," he said. "The problem is how to do it." The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents. In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular. The official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes. Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops, but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land. "As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the future," the China Daily said in an editorial last month. Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it. For most of the period of Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative. "New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long-term investment," the newspaper said. REUTER 
CHINA OFFICIAL CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT GRAIN POLICY

The grain output of a major Chinese grain-producing province is not increasing, because farmers lack incentives, production costs are rising, storage facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in grain, the province's vice-governor said. The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui, as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as they could growing grain, and three times as much growing cash crops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pct of farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investment had caused the area of irrigated land to fall. Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct of the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978. He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and a further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats. He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt with trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for more investment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal use of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the tendency to rely on grain imports. The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate to the National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He said the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four pct from 11 pct. "With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few years, some people got carried away, relaxing their attention to grain and cotton production," he said. On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be self-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from the northeast, but it imports wheat. "Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reach the 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be considered adequate," Tian said. REUTER 
ROTTERDAM GRAIN HANDLERS STAGE LIGHTNING STRIKES

Lightning strikes hit the grain sector of the port of Rotterdam today after employers turned down union demands for shorter working hours in a new labour agreement, transport union FNV spokesman Bert Duim said. Around 140 grain handlers stopped work, 125 of them at the two Europoort locations of Graan Elevator Mij (GEM), which handles about 95 pct of grain, oilseeds and derivatives passing through Rotterdam. GEM managing director Pieter van der Vorm said the facilities were 40 pct operational. The employers had invited the unions for talks later today, but details of the labour agreement would not be on the agenda, Van der Vorm said. It is barely one month since the end of an eight-week campaign of lightning strikes against redundancies in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, which stevedoring companies said cost them millions of guilders.

FRENCH FARMERS PLAN TO CUT MAIZE PLANTINGS

French farmers are planning to cut their maize sowings by between 100,000 and 150,000 hectares this year from the 1.87 mln ha harvested in 1986, the French Maize Producers' Association, AGPM, said. It said its first estimate of planting intentions indicated cuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region of Picardy and the Paris Basin, which harvested 192,000 ha last year. In the centre-west region of Poitou-Charentes, plantings were estimated four to seven pct up on last year's harvested 244,000 ha. Planting intentions in the south-east ranged between nine pct less and two pct more than last year's 125,000 ha. In the south-west the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similar area to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided water supplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after the last two years of drought. Meanwhile, the oilseed plant breeding association, AMSOL, said sunflower plantings in France this year are indicated at between 900,000 and 950,000 ha against 829,000 harvested last year, while soya plantings are indicated at 80,000 ha against last year's harvested 48,000.

HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP

Fresh, heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade sources said. They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production forecasts were made for all these crops. The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province. The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue. The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains. In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay. In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm. The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa. Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said. The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added. Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces. The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season. The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86. The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather permitting. Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4 to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private producers put 1985/86 production. The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production. The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers' targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week. The production forecast was reduced to between three and 3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4 to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86. The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to 7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes. These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources, and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes. The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop, sources said. Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further. The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season. Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Reuter 
AWB CALLS FOR TIGHTER WHEAT QUALITY CONTROLS

Australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said. "Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications," the board said in a submission to the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. "Many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in Australia," it said. The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system. Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said. It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping. Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing, it said. The submission also said Australia's federal system impeded the AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat. The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment. "It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored," it said. For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW) might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly, southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or Geelong, in Victoria. Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said. The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk handling authorities is not essential, although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained. An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner.

ZAMBIA EXPECTS SHARPLY REDUCED MAIZE CROP

Zambia's marketed maize production will probably fall to less than 630,000 tonnes in 1986/87 (May-Apr), from 918,000 last year, because of poor rainfall in major producing areas, Agriculture Minister Kingsley Chinkuli said. He told Parliament that in the southern provinces the harvest would be over 50 pct down on the level in the previous marketing year. "The nation would be lucky to produce over seven mln bags (630,000 tonnes) of maize this year," he stated. Chinkuli added that Zambia was setting up an irrigation fund with Canadian aid to lessen the effects of poor rainfall. REUTER 

ROTTERDAM'S MAIN GRAIN TERMINAL CLOSED BY STRIKE

Grain handling at Rotterdam port's main grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the largest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for the third day running. Pieter van der Vorm, managing director of Graan Elevator Mij (GEM), which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the port, said their main Europoort terminal was out of action because of a strike by technical staff. The actions, in support of union demands in negotiations over a new labour agreement, began on Wednesday when grain handlers stopped work. Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today's scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam would face delays, but this was not happening yet. Wednesday's actions left GEM's facilities 40 pct operational, and there were only limited strikes yesterday. Talks between unions and employers yesterday and today produced no result, but FNV spokesman Bert Duim said the union was prepared to put their key demand, for a 36 hour working week, at the bottom of the agenda. Van der Vorm said, however, the union's demands on a range of issues were far in excess of the management's final offer. REUTER 

PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER

Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview. No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said. Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable. The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops. Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds. The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said. Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's yield of 14.0 mln. He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly. The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual population growth rate of more than three pct. Current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes. The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said. This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a "strategic reserve" target of two mln tonnes. Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said. The government wants to keep an extra "safety margin" until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well, he said. The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo. Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply. Aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills. The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said. Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30. Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran. Reuter 

OPPOSITION LEADER WARNS OF FAMINE IN BANGLADESH

The failure of the Bangladesh government to tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to a famine, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Khaleda Zia, told a press conference yesterday. Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the country in March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheat sales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said. Ministry officials said the next harvest, due in mid-April will ease the situation. "Temporary grain shortage in the arid north and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual at this time of the year," one official said. Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials and failure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis. Her remarks coincided with newspaper reports that a continuing heat wave has destroyed thousands of acres of crops in the south-west. Officials said last week Bangladesh now has only 390,000 tonnes of grain in stock which would be exhausted in two or three weeks. Bangladesh expects to produce 14.5 mln tonnes of rice and 1.5 mln tonnes of wheat in 1986/87 ending June 30.

CHINESE CROPS HIT BY FROST, SNOW AND RAIN IN MARCH

Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China suffered considerable damage because of frost during a spell of unusually cold weather in late March, the China Daily said. It said average temperatures for the last 10 days of March in most of east China were three to five degrees centigrade below average. Snow fell in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and Henan, making early rice sowing difficult. Heavy snow blanketted central and south Jilin and north Liaoning, leaving farmland too muddy for spring ploughing and sowing, the paper said. The paper said rainfall during the last 10 days of March in areas south of the Yangtze had been much higher than normal. Heavy rain fell last Sunday in parts of Guangdong, ending a particularly arid dry season and marking the start of the flood season, it said. It gave no further details. The New China News Agency said rain and snow in Henan had improved the prospects for wheat, sown on 4.8 mln hectares, and caused a drop in grain prices at rural fairs since late February. It gave no 1986 figures for comparison. REUTER 
SOVIET GRAIN PRODUCTS MINISTRY CRITICISED

The Soviet Communist Party has criticised the country's Grain Products Ministry for failing to ensure proper grain storage, turning out poor quality bread and for unsatisfactory book keeping, Pravda said. The party daily said that losses in the industry owing to waste and theft amounted to 7.3 mln roubles over the last two and a half years. The situation was particularly bad in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, which has been severely criticised since the ousting of its veteran leader Dinmukhamed Kunayev last December. Its new leader, Gennady Kolbin, has said that at times the grain-growing republic has performed so badly that it has been obliged to seek grain supplies from national reserves. Tass news agency announced yesterday that Grain Products Minister Grigory Zolotukhin, 75, was being retired and replaced by Alexander Budyka, a senior food industry official. Pravda added today that the crisis in the industry had been drawn to Zolotukhin's attention and two of his deputies reprimanded. REUTER 

THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER

Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5 billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a year ago, the Business Economics Department said. It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials and semi-finished products. The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the first quarter due to lower oil prices. The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6 billion baht from 56.6 billion. Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower earnings from many key commodities including rice whose earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26 pct and canned pineapples seven pct. Products registering high export growth were jewellery up 64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct. REUTER 
ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE

The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry of Agriculture economist said. Reuter 
FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED

Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years. Reuter 
BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS

Storage problems with Brazil's record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries. Reuter 

FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987

The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand. FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in 1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America. World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S. "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially on the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said. FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986 harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes. FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union. REUTER 

INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88

India's national foodgrain target has been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its annual report for 1986/87. Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87 due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological sub-divisions of the country. The report gave the targets for various crops with estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following, in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13). Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said. The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84 respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4 mln. India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year development plan ending March 31, 1990. Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the 1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with good weather, the report said. "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be vigrously pursued," it said. Reuter 

BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT

Based on field travel in the Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report. The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop. It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness. However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said. The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said. Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said. Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested. During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said. New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests. Reuter 

DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS

A prolonged dry spell has damaged 111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials said. They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing conditions continued until next month. Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry spell. Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice), representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8 mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said. About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at 170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said. Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total thus the damage is considered negligible. In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified into the cash crop from sugar two years ago. The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to 320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no reports of actual damage. REUTER 
AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS

Australia could lose valuable wheat markets through lack of availability if plantings for the coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said. "If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its valuable markets," he said in a statement. Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May. However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were facing enormous financial pressures. He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about 16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available. If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said. "Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat understand a decrease in production due to drought but they will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to decrease production," Condon said. "If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export income earner, governments and government authorities will need to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing viability of the wheat industry," he added. Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan. REUTER 

EC TO OFFER ARGENTINA GRAIN SALE COMPENSATION

The European Community is to offer Argentina compensation for its loss of maize and sorghum exports to Spain following Spain's accession to the EC, EC sources said. They said the offer will be made next week in Geneva, headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and will also involve products other than cereals. They gave no further details. Argentine exports of sorghum to Spain fell to zero last year from 300,000 tonnes in 1985, while maize sales fell to 15,000 tonnes from 994,000, official EC statistics show. The sources noted that an agreement between the EC and the U.S. guarantees special access to the Spanish market for two mln tonnes of non-EC maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum each year for the next four years. But they said various details of this accord will tend to inhibit imports from Argentina. These include a provision for reduction of the amounts if Spain imports cereals substitutes, and the EC's plan to import the special maize and sorghum on a regular monthly basis. Argentina tends to have exportable quantities only three or four times a year. Reuter 

Drought has hit another 189,000 hectares, with 40,000 hectares very badly affected, it said. Insecticides are in short supply so only the most endangered rice fields should be sprayed, the radio added. The affected areas -- the Red River delta and other coastal areas in northern Vietnam -- produce between 30 to 40 per cent of the country's rice. The radio report, monitored in Bangkok on April 20 but only translated here over the weekend, said the threatened damage was spread over twice as large an area as last year. Vietnam has not been able to grow enough food for its expanding population, with the Soviet Union buying rice in Thailand and Burma in recent years for supply to Vietnam. Vietnam produced 18.2 million tonnes of food, most of it rice, last year and hopes to boost that to 23-24 million tonnes by 1990. REUTER 
EC OFFICIALS PLAN NEW EFFORT ON FARM PRICE TALKS

European Community (EC) leaders hope to make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks on reforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when EC agriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions here this morning. Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen met Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night to plan a new initiative. Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker, who currently chairs EC farm ministers' meetings, were said to be disappointed by the lack of progress in the talks so far this week. The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a tough package involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct in farmers' returns for many crops this year. Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 but are only this week getting down to serious negotiations. Yesterday, they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by 2.5 pct, and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to EC stores, to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by larger margins, and to impose a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds, a proposal which would be likely to sour EC trade relations with the United States. Diplomatic sources said ministers, all of whom are opposed to at least one of these propositions, maintained entrenched positions yesterday, making the task of de Keersmaeker in steering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one. They said he could also be treading a minefield if he sought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers over plans to change the system by which EC farm prices, expressed in a notional common currency, are translated into the currencies of member states. West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday he would veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area, saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currency nations. The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present a paper to his colleagues which, while not having the status of a compromise proposal, would attempt to narrow their options. But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministers like Kiechle, with his commitment to maintaining traditional rural patterns, and others who see runaway farm spending as unacceptable economically, is likely to prove extremely difficult to bridge. They agreed with EC farmers' union association president Hans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in June appeared to be the best that could be hoped for. Reuter 
EC FARM MINISTERS END PRICES MEETING STILL DIVIDED

European Community (EC) agriculture ministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeply divided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of the EC's farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns. Their chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker, told a news conference after the meeting he would work on a paper setting out possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks, with the hope that the ministers can get down to detailed negotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18. But diplomats said the talks this week had served little more than to clarify member states' positions on the complex package of measures proposed by the commission. The executive body has proposed measures which would result in price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct. Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion European currency units, to help the EC's cash crisis, and changes in the conversion of EC common farm prices into national currencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German and Dutch farmers. De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differences between EC states on the oils tax proposal, the currency measures and the key question of cereals prices and associated measures. But he told journalists, "We have used this meeting to reach the point at which real negotiations can start at the next meeting. Ideally they should have started now but our procedures took much longer than planned." Ministers are in theory supposed to agree a price package by April 1 each year, although this target is seldom reached in practice. Diplomats said on all the points there were widely diverging views, with Britain and the Netherlands, the countries most supportive of commission proposals for cereals price cuts, strongly opposed to the oils tax. However, de Keersmaeker said West German objections to the monetary proposals could prove the most difficult issue to resolve. "This is a very tough political nut, and because of the very nature of the problem there is no technical solution," he said. Commission sources said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen was prepared to alter some technical aspects of his proposals to make an agreement easier. However, because of the EC's budgetary crisis, he had little room for concessions to pleas for a cut in the impact of his proposals on farmers' incomes as several ministers, led by Germany's Ignaz Kiechle, are demanding. EC Commission president Jacques Delors has warned that the EC will have an accumulated budgetary deficit of over five billion Ecus by the end of this year, even if the commission farm price package is adopted in its entirety.

SOVIET SPRING CROPS SOWN ON ONLY 11 PCT OF LAND

Soviet farmers had sown spring crops on only 15.8 mln hectares or 11 pct of cultivated land by April 27, compared with 26.2 mln ha by April 21, 1986, Izvestia said. Grains and pulses (except maize) were sown on 6.7 mln ha, compared with 13.1 mln at the same time last year, it added. Spring sowing is off to a slow start, with planting two to four weeks behind schedule in many areas of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia, because the winter was unusually cold. Western agricultural experts believe the crop could still be good but heavy winterkill will make it difficult to reach the 1987 grain target of 232 mln tonnes. The 1986 crop was 210 mln. Reuter 
BANGLADESH KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN ON GRAIN PENALTY

Bangladesh is keeping its options open on whether to seek a penalty from Continental Grain Co of the United States for alleged breach of a wheat shipment contract, but is also asking the company to expedite shipment of the cargo, a senior Food Ministry official said. The official, who declined to be named, said the company under a deal agreed to ship 100,000 tonnes of wheat by April 7 and another 100,000 tonnes by April 16. But it shipped only 126,000 tonnes altogether. The supplier will have to pay penalty at a rate of two dlrs per tonne for every delayed day according to a document signed by both the Food Ministry and the suppliers' agent in Dhaka, he told Reuters. "If they arrange quick shipment, we may take a lenient view," the official said. The issue is expected to be decided at a cabinet meeting scheduled for next Sunday, he added. A pro-government Bengali daily "Dainik Janata" reported today that Continental Grain could face a penalty of 200 mln taka (6.49 mln dlrs) for alleged failure to maintain shipment schedule. The local agent of Continental Grain, Shafi Ahmed Choudhury, told Reuters he applied to the Bangladesh government for an extension of the shipment period because loading of wheat at London was being delayed due to bad weather and a faulty elevator at a grain silo. But the government has not yet granted the extension, he said. Choudhury said the freight rate and price of wheat had gone up after the deal was signed, which resulted in a financial loss to the company. He said he was not "officially informed" of the move to impose a penalty, although he was "not totally unaware of it." Continental Grain officials in New York declined to comment. Reuter 
CHINA PROVINCE BECOMES GRAIN IMPORTER

The south China province of Guangdong is importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said. The official magazine said the province's grain area fell to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares. Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane, bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures. The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place. It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and low productivity make grain the least profitable farm commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1 hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added. It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only gradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system. REUTER 
FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials. The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers' Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or end-of-season stocks. However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end 1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April. The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984. This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around 31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares against 4.61 mln in 1986/87. ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC official said. Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said. He said, however, that among countries to which France could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said. The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in 1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature, was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said. Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were expected to be higher, the AGPM official said. It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares, down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87. Reuter 
ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT

The Zambian government today announced minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting. However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal, were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more sweeping reductions. Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food. Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns. In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign of troops or police reinforcements on the streets. President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1. The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity program. Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile region to take action against shops that did not reduce their prices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed in the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the government tried to lift maize subsidies. Reuter 

BOMB THREATS, STRIKES AS FIJI SEES END TRADE BAN

Fiji today welcomed the ending of a trade ban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of the country's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressure for his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures. The government welcomed a decision by the Australian Waterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14. The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat, fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice and wheat from an Australian port, the government said. Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugar industry, closed again today in support of Bavadra. In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of the Australian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to be a hoax. Bavadra has launched a campaign of civil disobedience to press for his reinstatement. Reuter 
ITALIAN BARLEY CROP REPORTED IN GOOD CONDITION

Italy's barley crop is generally in good condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam said. First consignments were expected to be available around mid-June. Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia, which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop because of extreme dryness. Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks. Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national production would be around two pct higher than in the previous season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said. If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an increase of 11 pct compared to 1986. Reuter 

INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS

Indonesia rejected World Bank recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5 billion dlrs in grants and soft loans. Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met at The Hague, said, "The general argument presented by the Bank for this free trade, open economy view is weak." The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming. The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked and the subsidies are a waste of money. Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers, exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers. Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the government would continue to maintain production targets for "strategic commodities" such as rice and sugar. The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country would save money by importing the commodity. However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive. He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry develop and because of "over-production and price intervention in the developed nations."

GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT

Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather, the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today. Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid programme. The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows government concern over "lower than average rainfall in southern Ghana and its implications for the major harvest." Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava. GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls. The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously affected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts of the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have dried up. Reuter 

The Pakistani government allowed the private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy announced to cover the next three years. Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn. Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations. He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and to enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said. Reuter 
PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS

Pakistani government allowed freer cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap. Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech the government had also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of Pakistani products. Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. But Haq said now the private sector would also export cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a long-standing demand of the local traders. The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries compete effectively in the world market, he said. Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but reviewed every year. It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a longer period. He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided for the export of engineering goods to selected third world countries on soft credit terms. Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23 billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86. He said the government policy was to rationalise and streamline import controls. "It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports, specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs," he said. "Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise to smuggling and hampering of exports." He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed from import restrictions. Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a balance of payments crisis for Pakistan. Reuter 

SPAIN APPEALS FOR EC HELP ON MAIZE IMPORTS

Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero, speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources said. Spain is threatened with massive imports from third countries by the end of the year, they said. They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum into Spain from third countries this year. Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to make direct purchases. The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the Spanish market. They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help. The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the meeting. Reuter 

SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT

Recent announcements from Moscow of next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes, Agriculture Department analysts said. USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes. Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday, putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be "25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year." "This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne (grain) crop," the analyst said. In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235 mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure published in a Soviet economic journal this month. USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said. Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said. While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest. A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes. Reuter 

SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS

The Soviet Union outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry. Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987. Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the output of a country's goods and services. He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986. Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets. "Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a considerable amount of the equipment that it requires," said Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN. Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods, increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987 compared with the same period last year. However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned for the industry for the whole of 1988. Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to a large extent on conserving resources better. "Large-scale measures are planned to save resources," he said. Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same figure as was announced last year. Western governments view official Soviet estimates for defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are intertwined with the civilian economy. Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending next year on medical services, education, pensions and social insurance schemes. Reuter 
THAI TRADERS PLAN MAIZE FUTURES MARKET

Thai traders plan to establish a company to regulate maize forward trading, in what could be a first step towards a commodities futures exchange, maize dealers said. Traders and Internal Trade Department officials agreed last week to commission a study on a structure to regulate maize forward trading and to set up a company, Thailand Commodity Exchange Co Ltd, with 30 businesses as shareholders who will act as brokers in the futures market. Chanthong Pattamapong, a commodities trader asked to to draw up the study, said if the maize futures market succeeds it may be extended to other commodities, perhaps sugar and rubber. REUTER 
CHINA FORECASTS 397 MLN TONNES GRAIN HARVEST

China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be 397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New China News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman as saying. The harvest will be China's second highest in history but poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said. Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall. Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09 mln in the same 1986 period. Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase the incentive for grain production. China could not afford to become a major food importer, he said. The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's 1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390 mln tonnes.
